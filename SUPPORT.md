# Support

Are you having trouble with our documentation or having some issues with a guide?
We have multiple channels available for you to request help.

## Where to get help

If you're in need of help with authoring your content for zkSync Docs,
first read through the [Contribution Guidelines](https://docs.zksync.io/build/contributing-to-documentation/contribution-guidelines)
to see if it may help answer some questions.
If the content there does not solve your problem, submit an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/issues)
and we can try to help resolve the issue.

### Help with developer related issues
If you are referencing the documentation for a project as a developer and run into issues,
you can go to the [zksync-developers Discussions](https://github.com/zkSync-Community-Hub/zksync-developers/discussions)
where you can submit a question. We also have a [Discord community](https://join.zksync.dev/)
that may help with any troubleshooting.

If you have questions related to any of our zkSync tools,
we recommend that you submit an Issue related to that project.
You can find the list of our open-source repositories in the [Contribution Track](https://docs.zksync.io/build/resources/contribution-track)
on our zkSync Docs site.

## ðŸª² Submit a bug report

Have you come across a bug while going through our documentation?
Perhaps the versions are out of date or a particular tool is broken when trying to run a project.
Submit an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-docs/issues) using our Bug Issue form
or submit feedback directly from the page! In the right sidebar on the site, there is a link below the Table of Contents
for "Share feedback" which will set up a pre-filled Issue form for the page you're on.
