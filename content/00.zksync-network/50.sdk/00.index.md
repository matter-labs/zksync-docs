description: "Overview of official SDKs for building on ZKsync chains using familiar Ethereum development tools."
---

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
The following SDKs provide ZKsync-specific functionalities for EraVM-based chains. For ZKsync OS based chains, developers can use default Ethereum SDKs.
::

ZKsync SDKs provide native support for interacting with ZKsync chains while extending existing Ethereum development libraries.
This means you can use the same tools and workflows you already know, with added features for ZKsync-specific operations.

## JavaScript SDKs

ZKsync offers multiple SDKs for the JavaScript ecosystem, extending both `ethers` and `viem` to support ZKsync networks.
