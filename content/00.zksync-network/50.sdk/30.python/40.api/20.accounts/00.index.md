The ZKsync Python SDK offers classes for signing ZKsync transactions:

- **`Wallet`**: Manage and sign transactions with ZKsync features.
- **`EthSigner`**: Sign transactions with an Ethereum signer.
- **`SmartAccount`**: Support account abstraction with factory classes:
  - **`ECDSASmartAccount`**: Use a single ECDSA key.
  - **`MultisigECDSASmartAccount`**: Use multiple ECDSA keys.

### Why use these classes?

They simplify ZKsync blockchain interactions by providing:

- **Security**: Securely manage private keys and sign transactions.
- **Convenience**: Easily create and manage accounts with advanced features.
- **Compatibility**: Extend existing libraries for seamless project integration.

### Classes

#### `Wallet`

The `Wallet` class allows you to create and manage wallets, sign transactions, and interact with the ZKsync network seamlessly.

#### `EthSigner`

The `EthSigner` class signs ZKsync transactions using an Ethereum signer, enabling compatibility with Ethereum-based
tools and workflows.

#### `SmartAccount`

The `SmartAccount` class provides better support for account abstraction, allowing for more advanced account
management features. Factory classes for `SmartAccount` include:

- **`ECDSASmartAccount`**: Uses a single ECDSA key for signing payloads.
- **`MultisigECDSASmartAccount`**: Uses multiple ECDSA keys for signing payloads.

These classes enhance the functionality and security of managing accounts and signing transactions on the ZKsync
network using the Python SDK.
