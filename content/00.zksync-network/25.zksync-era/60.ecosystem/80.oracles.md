## DIA

[DIA](https://docs.diadata.org/products/token-price-feeds) token price feeds provide smart
contract real-time price information of 3,000+ cryptocurrencies, transparently sourced from 80+
trusted, high-volume DEXs and CEXs. Check out the usage guide below to get started today!

### Gelato

[Gelato](https://docs.gelato.network/web3-services/vrf/understanding-vrf) provides access to Verifiable Random
Functions (VRF) on ZKsync. VRFs are cryptographic primitives that generate pseudorandom numbers in a way that is
provably secure and verifiable. A VRF allows a holder of a private key to produce a random number along with a proof
that the number was generated legitimately (making it publically verifiable). More information, including how to use
VRFs in your dApp, can be found in the Gelato docs.

## Pyth

[Pythnet](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds) price feeds use a "pull"
price update model, where users are responsible for posting price updates on-chain when needed.

## RedStone

[RedStone](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/introduction) delivers frequently updated,
reliable, and diverse data feeds for your dApp and smart contracts. Check out all the price
