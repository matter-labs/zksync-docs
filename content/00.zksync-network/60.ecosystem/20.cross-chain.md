## CCIP

[Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)](https://chain.link/cross-chain) enables developers to build secure cross-chain applications
that can transfer tokens, send messages, and initiate actions across blockchains. Through the Cross-Chain Token (CCT) standard, CCIP enables token
developers to integrate new and existing tokens with CCIP in a self-serve manner within minutes, without requiring vendor lock-in, hard-coded
functions, or external dependencies that may limit future optionality. CCTs support self-serve deployments, full control and ownership
for developers, zero-slippage transfers, and enhanced programmability via configurable rate limits and reliability features such as Smart Execution.
CCIP is powered by Chainlink decentralized oracle networks (DONs)â€”a proven standard with a track record of securing tens of
billions of dollars and enabling over $21 trillion in onchain transaction value.

## LayerZero

[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network) is an interoperability protocol that connects blockchains (50+ and counting), allowing developers to build seamless
omnichain applications, tokens, and experiences. The protocol relies on immutable on-chain
endpoints, a configurable Security Stack, and a permissionless set of Executors
to transfer censorship-resistant messages between chains.
