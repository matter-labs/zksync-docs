## Chronicle

[Chronicle](https://docs.chroniclelabs.org/Developers/tutorials/Remix)
offers cost-efficient, scalable, decentralized,

## DIA

[DIA](https://docs.diadata.org/products/token-price-feeds) token price feeds provide smart
contract real-time price information of 3,000+ cryptocurrencies, transparently sourced from 80+
trusted, high-volume DEXs and CEXs. Check out the usage guide below to get started today!

### Gelato

[Gelato](https://docs.gelato.network/web3-services/vrf/understanding-vrf) provides access to Verifiable Random
Functions (VRF) on ZKsync. VRFs are cryptographic primitives that generate pseudorandom numbers in a way that is
provably secure and verifiable. A VRF allows a holder of a private key to produce a random number along with a proof
that the number was generated legitimately (making it publically verifiable). More information, including how to use
VRFs in your dApp, can be found in the Gelato docs.

## Pyth

[Pythnet](https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds) price feeds use a "pull"
price update model, where users are responsible for posting price updates on-chain when needed.

## RedStone

[RedStone](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/introduction) delivers frequently updated,
reliable, and diverse data feeds for your dApp and smart contracts. Check out all the price
feeds available to ZKsync Era and get started with the provided usage guide.
