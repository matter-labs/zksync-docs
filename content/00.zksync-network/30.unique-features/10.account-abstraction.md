ZKsync Era natively supports Account Abstraction, making it possible to implement smart accounts
that contain arbitrary logic, making features like account recovery, native multi-sig accounts, and others.

To learn more about the design of Account Abstraction, see the [Protocol documentation](/zksync-protocol/era-vm/account-abstraction).
