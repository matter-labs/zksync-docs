---

ZKsync Connect enables interoperability across ZKsync chains in the Elastic Network.
Interop, or interoperability, is a way to communicate and transact between two ZKsync Stack chains.
It is made possible by smart contracts that verify transactions across chains using Merkle proofs.

It allows you to:

1. **Observe messages**: Track when an interop message (think of it as a special event) is created on the source chain.
1. **Send assets:** Transfer ERC20 tokens and other assets between chains.
1. **Execute calls:** Call a contract on a remote chain with specific calldata and value.
  With interop, you automatically get an account (a.k.a. `aliasedAccount`) on each chain, which you can control from the source chain.
1. **Execute bundles of calls:** Group multiple remote calls into a single bundle, ensuring all of them execute at once.
1. **Execute transactions:** Create transactions on the source chain, which will automatically get executed on the destination chain,
  with options to choose from various cross-chain Paymaster solutions to handle gas fees.

## Enhanced user experience

Interoperability enhances the blockchain user experience by abstracting complex cross-chain interactions.
Users do not need to manually bridge funds to another chain in the Elastic Network if they already have funds on one.

- **Reduced Complexity**: Users interact with a seamless interface that hides the underlying complexities of blockchain operations.
- **Asset Bridging**: Relayers manage the process of bridging assets between chains,
  handling the necessary burning and minting of assets as they move across the ecosystem.
- **Lower Fees**: By leveraging efficient relayers and minimizing manual operations,
  transaction costs are kept low, akin to standard gas fees within a single chain.

## Real-World Application: Crosschain Transactions

Consider a practical scenario where you want to swap ETH for DAI using a crosschain transaction on a defi platform:

1. **Transaction Initiation**: You initiate the transaction directly from your wallet.
2. **Relayer Involvement**: A relayer picks up your ETH and deposits it into the defi chain.
3. **Asset Swap**: On the defi chain, your ETH is automatically swapped for DAI.
4. **Completion and Return**: The relayer then transfers the DAI back to your original chain.

This entire process is executed as a single transaction, making it feel as seamless as if no chain-switching occurred.
The only difference a user might notice is a slightly longer confirmation time, depending on the specific ZKsync chain used.

## Transaction Lifecycle

An interop transaction in the Elastic Network follows these steps:

1. **Initiation**: A transaction is initiated on a ZKsync chain, aimed at crossing to another chain within the Elastic Network.
2. **Settlement on L1**: The sending ZKsync chain compiles a cryptographic proof of the transaction and settles it onto Ethereum's Layer 1,
  anchoring the transaction's validity.
3. **Transaction Root Update**: Ethereum's Layer 1 updates the Transaction Root, a cumulative record reflecting all
 transactions processed across the Elastic Network.
4. **Root Importation**: The receiving ZKsync chain imports this updated Transaction Root through its consensus mechanism,
  akin to the way Layer 1 to Layer 2 messages are currently handled.
5. **Transaction Submission**: A relayer submits the transaction along with a Merkle Proof to the receiving ZKsync chain.
  This proof connects the transaction to the newly updated Transaction Root.
6. **Verification and Execution**: The receiving ZKsync chain verifies the transaction against the Transaction Root.
  If the verification is successful, the transaction is executed, and the relayer is compensated for their service.
7. **Proof Settlement**: Finally, the receiving ZKsync chain settles its proof on L1, conclusively validating the transaction within the Elastic Network.

## Rollout Phases

There are three steps planned for rolling out full interoperability:

1. [Messaging](/zksync-network/unique-features/zksync-connect/messaging)
1. Asset transfers and bundles
1. Crosschain transactions

Currently only messaging is available as a part of the `v29` upgrade.
Only chains that settle on top of [Gateway](/zksync-protocol/gateway/overview) have access to interop messaging.
To see which chains use ZKsync Gateway, check the [Elastic Network Chains](/zksync-network/environment) table.

Limitations for this first state of interop include:

- NoÂ support for selecting destination chains
- Lack of nullifiers or replay protection
- No cancellation mechanism
- No support for sending assets or calling contracts

These limitations will be addressed in steps 2 and 3 of full universal interoperability.
