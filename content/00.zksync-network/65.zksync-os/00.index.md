description: Learn about the ZKsync OS Developer Preview testnet and its architecture.
---

The **ZKsync OS Developer Preview** testnet is a new environment that runs on the latest architecture introduced in the [**Atlas upgrade**](https://zksync.mirror.xyz/XrlYJN9SUbOtRn9nyqrfPyaAqot--PlUcnSRK_OF1Bs).
It includes all major components released in that upgrade — **ZKsync OS**, the **new Sequencer**, and the **Airbender prover** — giving developers
early access to the full next-generation ZK Stack.

This testnet allows builders to deploy contracts, profile system performance, and explore how the ZK Stack has
evolved across execution, sequencing, and proving.

---

## Overview

**ZKsync OS** is the new operating system of the ZK Stack.
It defines the system-level state transition function of a chain and supports multiple **Execution Environments (EEs)**.

Unlike earlier implementations, ZKsync OS unifies **execution and proving logic** in one codebase and compiles it to two targets — **x86** for
the sequencer runtime and **RISC-V** for the Airbender proving system.

The Developer Preview testnet runs **ZKsync OS alongside the new Sequencer and Airbender prover**, providing a complete
environment for testing the latest stack.

---

## Architecture

The core protocol is organized into two primary layers:

- **Execution layer:** defines transaction logic, memory handling, and IO. It computes new state from the previous block state and inputs.
- **Proving layer:** generates ZK proofs that attest to the correctness of that state transition.

ZKsync OS is implemented in **Rust** and compiled to two targets:

- **x86:** used by the Sequencer to execute transactions
- **RISC-V:** used by the Airbender prover to generate ZK proofs of correctness

This “one program, two targets” model ensures *what you execute is what you prove*, eliminating discrepancies between
runtime and proof generation and reducing the audit surface.
Execution and proving operate as **decoupled services** (sequencer vs. prover) while sharing the exact same program and semantics.

## Components

### ZKsync OS

The core of the system.
ZKsync OS provides a modular execution framework that supports multiple execution environments and defines the rules for state transitions.

- **[Bootloader](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/bootloader):** initializes the system and coordinates transaction execution.
- **[Execution Environments](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/execution-environment):** interpreters that run user contracts and system logic.
- **[System Layer](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/system):** handles low-level IO (storage, events, L1 messages) and manages memory.

The Developer Preview currently supports a **fully EVM-equivalent environment**, allowing developers to use
existing EVM tools (e.g. Foundry, Hardhat, solc) and deploy contracts without modification.
Future versions may include **EraVM**, **WASM** and **native RISC-V** environments.

Learn [more about ZKsync OS in the protocol documentation](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos).

### Sequencer

The new **Sequencer**, introduced as part of the [Atlas upgrade](https://zksync.mirror.xyz/XrlYJN9SUbOtRn9nyqrfPyaAqot--PlUcnSRK_OF1Bs), is designed for:

- **High throughput** — sustained >15K TPS in ERC-20 transfer benchmarks
- **Low latency** — sub-second inclusion, typically 250–500 ms
- **Modularity** — clear separation of execution, API, and proving layers

It offloads batching and L1 coordination to asynchronous services, simplifying the execution pipeline and improving resilience.
For developers, this means faster transaction processing and easier scaling for custom ZK Stack chains.

---

### Airbender Prover

**Airbender** is the proving system used in the Developer Preview testnet.
It is a general-purpose, open-source RISC-V zkVM integrated directly with ZKsync OS.

Key properties:

- **Efficient hardware utilization** — can run on a single GPU.
- **Low cost** — proving an ERC-20 transfer costs roughly $0.0001.
- **Fast proofs** — Airbender can be scaled horizontally to generate ~1 second block proofs and **minutes-to-Ethereum finality**.

Because both execution and proving compile from the same Rust source, Airbender proves the exact code path executed by ZKsync OS.
This reduces audit complexity and guarantees consistency between runtime and proofs.

## Developer Preview Testnet

The Developer Preview testnet includes:

- **ZKsync OS** — modular execution layer with full EVM equivalence.
- **New Sequencer** — redesigned high-performance execution engine.
- **Airbender** — integrated real-time RISC-V prover.

Developers can use this testnet to:

- Deploy and test contracts using familiar EVM tooling
- Benchmark transaction throughput and latency
- Integration test for infrastructure tools
- Evaluate how the new architecture supports specific workloads
