title: Deploy contract using Hardhat
---

Now that we have setup our environment and our wallet, we are ready to deploy our first contract! For this tutorial we'll focus on theÂ `/contracts/ZeekAdventures.sol`Â contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @title ZeekAdventures
 * @dev Embark on adventures with Zeek, the playful cat mascot. This contract allows
 * setting and retrieving Zeek's current adventure.
 */
contract ZeekAdventures {
    // Zeek's current adventure
    string private adventure;

    // Event to announce when Zeek's adventure is set
    event AdventureSet(string newAdventure);

    /**
     * @dev Constructor to set the initial adventure upon deployment.
     * @param _initialAdventure The initial adventure Zeek will embark on.
     */
    constructor(string memory _initialAdventure) {
        adventure = _initialAdventure;
        emit AdventureSet(_initialAdventure);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Sets a new adventure for Zeek.
     * @param _newAdventure The new adventure Zeek will embark on.
     */
    function setAdventure(string memory _newAdventure) public {
        adventure = _newAdventure;
        emit AdventureSet(_newAdventure);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Returns the current adventure Zeek is on.
     * @return The current adventure of Zeek.
     */
    function currentAdventure() public view returns (string memory) {
        return adventure;
    }
}
```

### Compile contract

Smart contracts deployed to zkSync must be compiled using our custom compilers. For this particular guide we are making use of `zksolc`.

To compile the contracts in the project, run the following command:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn compile:contracts
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run compile:contracts
```

```bash [npm]
npm run compile:contracts
```

```bash [bun]
bun run compile:contracts
```
::

**You'll get the following output:**

```bash
Compiling contracts for zkSync Era with zksolc v1.4.1 and solc v0.8.23
Compiling 1 Solidity files
Successfully compiled 1 Solidity files
âœ¨  Done in 1.55s.
```

The compiled artifacts will be located in the `/artifacts-zk` folder.

### Deploy

In this section, weâ€™ll get to deploy the ZeekAdventure contract onto {network}. The script to deploy contracts is found at `/deploy/deploy.ts`. 

The `contractArtifactName` defines the contract we want to deploy.Here we have it set to our contract, ZeekAdventure. Similarly, `constructorArguments` are the arguments we need to provide to the constructor to initialize the contract. 

To deploy the contract, run the following command: 

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn deploy
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run deploy
```

```bash [npm]
npm run deploy
```

```bash [bun]
bun run deploy
```
::

**You'll get the following output:**

```bash
Starting deployment process of "ZeekAdventures"...
Estimated deployment cost: 0.0000648863 ETH

"ZeekAdventures" was successfully deployed:
 - Contract address: 0x0BaF96A7f137B05d0D35b76d59B16c86C1791D8D

```

ðŸ¥³ Congratulations! You just deployed a smart contract to {network}!
