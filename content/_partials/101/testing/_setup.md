## Setup the project

Make sure to go through the setup provided in the initial [Getting started](/zksync-network/guides/zksync-101) section.
You will have downloaded the 101 project through ZKsync CLI `create`.
Since we will use the local `hardhat` network for testing, you do not need to have a
in-memory node running for this section.
