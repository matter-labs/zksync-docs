  1. Obtaining Testnet ETH:

      - Use the [LearnWeb3 faucet](https://learnweb3.io/faucets/zksync_sepolia/)
      to directly receive testnet ETH on zkSync Sepolia.
      - Alternatively, acquire SepoliaETH from [recommended faucets](https://www.notion.so/tooling/network-faucets.md) and
      transfer it to the zkSync Sepolia testnet via the [zkSync bridge](https://portal.zksync.io/bridge/?network=sepolia).

  1. Verify your balance:

      - Check your wallet's balance using the zkSync Sepolia explorer.

  To deploy contracts, you'll need to securely add your wallet's private key to the project environment:

  1. **Extract Your Private Key:**
      - Find your wallet's private key. For MetaMask users, here's how to
      [export your wallet's private key](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).
      If you're in the local environment, use a private key from the available rich accounts.

  1. **Prepare the Environment File:**
      - Locate the **`.env-example`** file in your project directory. Rename this file to **`.env`**.

  1. **Add Your Private Key:**
      - Open the `.env` file and add your private key in the following format:

        ```sh
        WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
        ```

      - Replace **`your_private_key_here`** with your actual private key.
