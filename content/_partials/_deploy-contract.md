  Deploying contracts on the zkSync Sepolia testnet requires having testnet ETH.
  If you're working within the local development environment,
  you can utilize pre-configured rich wallets and skip this step.
  For testnet deployments, follow these steps to secure your funds:

    1. Obtaining Testnet ETH:
      - Use the [LearnWeb3 faucet](https://learnweb3.io/faucets/zksync_sepolia/) to directly receive testnet ETH on zkSync Sepolia.
      - Alternatively, acquire SepoliaETH from [recommended faucets](https://www.notion.so/tooling/network-faucets.md) and transfer it to the zkSync Sepolia testnet via the [zkSync bridge](https://portal.zksync.io/bridge/?network=sepolia).

    1. Verify your balance:
      - Check your wallet's balance using the [zkSync Sepolia explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/).
