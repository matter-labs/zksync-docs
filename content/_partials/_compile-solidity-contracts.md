title: Compile Solidity Contract
---

Smart contracts deployed to zkSync must be compiled using our custom compiler.
For this particular guide we are making use of `zksolc`.

To compile the contracts in the project, run the following command:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn compile
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm run compile
```

```bash [npm]
npm run compile
```

```bash [bun]
bun run compile
```
