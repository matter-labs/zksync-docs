title: Deploy contract using Foundry
---

Now that we have setup our environment and our wallet, we are ready to deploy our first contract! For this tutorial we'll focus on theÂ `/src/ZeekAdventures.sol`Â contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @title ZeekAdventures
 * @dev Embark on adventures with Zeek, the playful cat mascot. This contract allows
 * setting and retrieving Zeek's current adventure.
 */
contract ZeekAdventures {
    // Zeek's current adventure
    string private adventure;

    // Event to announce when Zeek's adventure is set
    event AdventureSet(string newAdventure);

    /**
     * @dev Constructor to set the initial adventure upon deployment.
     * @param _initialAdventure The initial adventure Zeek will embark on.
     */
    constructor(string memory _initialAdventure) {
        adventure = _initialAdventure;
        emit AdventureSet(_initialAdventure);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Sets a new adventure for Zeek.
     * @param _newAdventure The new adventure Zeek will embark on.
     */
    function setAdventure(string memory _newAdventure) public {
        adventure = _newAdventure;
        emit AdventureSet(_newAdventure);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Returns the current adventure Zeek is on.
     * @return The current adventure of Zeek.
     */
    function currentAdventure() public view returns (string memory) {
        return adventure;
    }
}
```

### Compile contract

To compile the contracts in the project, run the following command:

```bash
forge build --zksync
```

**You'll get the following output:**

```bash
TODO
```

The compiled artifacts will be located in the `/zkout` folder.

### Deploy

In this section, weâ€™ll get to deploy the ZeekAdventure contract onto {network}. The script to deploy contracts is found at `/scripts/deploy.s.sol`. 

// TODO:
@Dustin 
Write foundry script for deployment. Add and explain here. 

To deploy the contract, run the following command: 

```bash
forge script command --zksync
```

**You'll get the following output:**

```bash
TODO
```

ðŸ¥³ Congratulations! You just deployed a smart contract to {network}!
