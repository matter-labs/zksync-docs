::callout{icon="i-heroicons-information-circle-16-solid" color="amber"}
`foundry-zksync` is still in an alpha stage, so some features might not be fully supported
yet and may not work as fully intended. It is open-sourced and contributions are welcomed.

<!-- TODO: @dutterbutter
Need to update to include prerequisite of Foundry installation
This should be a simple curl request but needs to be setup by devops  -->

Run the following command in your terminal to create a new Foundry project using `foundry-zksync`.

  ```sh
  forge init --template https://github.com/dutterbutter/zksync-foundry-quickstart-guide
  ```
