This section provides an overview of the contracts deployed on EraVM chains.
The contracts covered consist of:

- System contracts: a set of contracts deployed on L2 that are responsible for various protocol functions.
- Bootloader: the smart contract that acts as an environment in which all the transactions are executed on L2.

Additionally, in this section, we cover advanced topics such as pubdata handling and specific precompiles.
