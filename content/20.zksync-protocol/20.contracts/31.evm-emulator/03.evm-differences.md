Given that the EVM Bytecode Emulator runs on top of EraVM, the some limitations and differences detailed in
the [Differences from Ethereum page](../../differences/evm-instructions) are inherited.
::

While the EVM Emulator is designed to execute EVM bytecode as closely as possible to Ethereum, there are several differences due
to the underlying **EraVM execution model**.
These differences affect gas accounting, opcode support, system behavior, and contract deployment.

This page outlines the key differences between the **EVM Emulator on ZKsync** and **Ethereum (Cancun)**.

## General Differences

- **Gas accounting uses EraVM gas units (ergs) instead of EVM gas.**
- **`JUMPDEST` analysis is simplified.** The emulator does not check whether `JUMPDEST` appears inside a `PUSH` instruction.
- **EVM contract creation does not charge additional gas for initcode size** (`2 gas per 32-byte chunk` from
  [EIP-3860](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3860) is omitted for EOAs and EraVM contract deployers but applied for EVM-to-EVM deployments).
- **Call stack depth limit is not explicitly enforced.** Instead, it is naturally constrained by the `63/64` gas forwarding rule.
- **EVM access lists (EIP-2930) are not supported.**
- **Warm/cold storage logic differs.**
  - Only contracts accessed within the EVM execution context are considered warm.
  - Access from EraVM does **not** affect EVM warm/cold storage tracking.
- **Contract storage is not cleared on deployment.** Unlike Ethereum, storage in newly created contracts is not explicitly reset.
- **EVM gas refund mechanisms are not implemented.**
- **Intrinsic gas costs differ from Ethereum.**
- **Contract deployment failures increment nonces.** This matches Ethereum behavior but differs from EraVM,
  where failed deployments do not affect the nonce.
- **Nonce storage uses `u128` instead of `u64`.**

## Gas Limit Behavior

- The **`GASLIMIT` opcode returns EraVM batch limits in ergs**, not the Ethereum gas limit.
- **Gas costs differ across opcodes.** Since EVM execution is emulated, each EVM instruction
  requires multiple EraVM instructions, increasing overall execution costs.

## Unsupported opcodes

Some opcodes like CALLCODE, SELFDESTRUCT, BLOBHASH and BLOBBASEFEE are not supported
on the EVM bytecode emulator as they're not supported on EraVM.

Check [the list of unsupported opcodes](../../differences/evm-instructions)

## Precompiles

Some precompiles like `RIPEMD-160` and `blake2f` are not supported on the EVM bytecode
emulator as they're not supported on EraVM.
