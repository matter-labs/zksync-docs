title: EVM bytecode deployment and execution
description: General details about deploying and executing EVM contracts on ZKsync
---

The **EVM Bytecode Interpreter** allows developers to deploy and execute **unmodified EVM contracts** on ZKsync
without requiring custom compilers. This section covers the **deployment process**, execution model, and key differences from standard EVM execution.

For a **deeper technical breakdown of how the interpreter works**, including memory layout, gas management, and
returndata handling, see **[Technical Architecture of the EVM Interpreter](./technical-details)**.

## Contract Deployment

EVM contracts can be deployed with a transaction without field `to` (as in Ethereum). In this case `data` field will be interpreted as
init code for the constructor.

Additionally EVM contracts can be deployed from EraVM environment using **system** call to the following functions in **ContractDeployer** system contract:

| **Function** | **Equivalent to** |
|-------------|------------------|
| `createEVM` | `CREATE` |
| `create2EVM` | `CREATE2` |

These methods use the same address derivation schemes as corresponding EVM opcodes.

### Address Derivation

- By **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs):** The contract address is derived using the **account nonce**.
- By **Smart Contract:** The contract address is derived using the **deployment nonce**.

See the [NonceHolder system contract documentation](../contracts/system-contracts#nonceholder)
for more details about two types of nonces in EraVM.

### Deployment from an EVM Contract

EVM contracts **cannot** call `createEVM` or `create2EVM` directly, as they rely on **system calls**, which are restricted in the EVM environment.
EVM opcodes `CREATE` and `CREATE2` should be used instead.

For a breakdown of how the interpreter handles EVM contract deployment internally, refer to
**[Technical Architecture of the EVM Interpreter](./technical-details#contract-deployment-process)**.

## Execution Flow

1. **Versioned Hash Check:**
   - The system reads the **contract’s versioned hash** from `AccountCodeStorage`.
   - If the contract is an **EVM contract (`0x02`)**, the **EVM Interpreter** is invoked.

2. **Bytecode Interpretation:**
   - The interpreter loads the **contract’s bytecode** and **executes it** using EVM rules.

3. **Gas Handling:**
   - A **conversion ratio** (5:1) is used to translate EraVM ergs limit to EVM gas limit.
   - EVM gas model is interpreted for compatibility. Actual transaction execution is paid in native EraVM gas (ergs).
      See **[EVM gas interpretation](./evm-gas-interpretation)** for details.
   - Since EVM execution requires multiple EraVM instructions per opcode, the **effective cost is higher** than for native EraVM contracts.

For a **detailed explanation of gas conversion, memory layout, and EVM interpretation internals**, see **[Technical Architecture of the EVM Interpreter](./technical-details#gas-management)**.

## Special Considerations

- **Transactions with a null `to` address are supported.** This allows EOAs to deploy EVM contracts.
- **Failed deployment by a contract increases deployment nonce.** This aligns with Ethereum but differs from EraVM, where failed deployments
  do not affect the nonce.
