title: EraVM ↔ EVM Contract Interactions
description: How different execution modes interact
---

EVM contracts and EraVM contracts can interact, but due to differences in execution models, some constraints exist.
The **EVM Bytecode Interpreter** ensures that EVM contracts execute in an environment that closely follows EVM semantics,
while EraVM contracts continue to operate natively.

This page covers the interaction rules, execution behavior, and limitations when calling between **EraVM and EVM contracts**.

This page contains technical details that may be redundant for most cases. In general, EVM and EraVM contracts can call each other.

## Calling an EVM Contract from an EraVM Contract

### Execution Flow

1. **EraVM contract makes a call** to an EVM contract.
2. The system reads the **versioned hash** of the target contract from `AccountCodeStorage`.
   - If the contract is **marked as an EVM contract** (`version 0x02`), the system redirects execution to the **EVM Interpreter**.
3. The EVM Interpreter:
   - Loads and interprets the EVM contract’s bytecode.
   - Executes the contract as if it were running on an EVM.
   - Returns the result in EraVM format.

### Gas Handling

- **EraVM contracts use ergs (EraVM gas).**
- When calling an EVM contract, fixed constant (5:1) is used to derive EVM gas from native EraVM gas.
- EVM gas is interpreted for compatibility. Actual execution is paid in native EraVM gas.
   See **[EVM gas interpretation](./evm-gas-interpretation)** for details.

### Data Handling

- **Calldata is passed as-is.** EraVM contracts do not need to modify the calldata when calling an EVM contract.
- **Returned data is forwarded directly** without modifications.

## Calling an EraVM Contract from an EVM Contract

### Execution Flow

1. **EVM contract calls an EraVM contract.**
2. The system detects that the target contract has an **EraVM-native versioned hash (`0x01`)**.
3. The system executes the contract using the **EraVM execution model**.

### Gas Handling

- **The EVM interpreter derives amount of native gas passed** using a fixed ratio (1:5).
- The call proceeds as a **native EraVM call** with the converted gas amount (or less, if remaining gas amount is not enough).

## Execution Constraints

### `delegatecall` Is Not Supported Between EVM and EraVM Contracts

- **EVM contracts cannot use `delegatecall` to EraVM contracts.**
- **EraVM contracts cannot use `delegatecall` to EVM contracts.**

This restriction prevents unintended access to system-level features and ensures execution isolation.

### Call stack depth

**EVM interpretation have no forced call stack depth limit.**
The 63/64 gas forwarding rule implicitly enforces a depth limitation in the same way as in EraVM.

### Out-of-Ergs Handling

- If the EVM interpretation frame runs out of **native EraVM gas (ergs)**, it triggers an internal panic that **reverts the entire EVM call stack**.
- If the EVM interpretation frame runs out of **EVM gas**, the revert propagates only to that contract’s execution context according to EVM rules.

See **[EVM gas interpretation](./evm-gas-interpretation)** for more details.

## Summary

| **Scenario** | **Supported?** | **Notes** |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **EraVM → EVM call** | ✅ | Calls invoke the EVM interpreter. EVM gas is derived from passed native EraVM gas (ergs). |
| **EVM → EraVM call** | ✅ | Calls execute using native EraVM logic with gas conversion. |
| **EraVM `delegatecall` to EVM** | ❌ | Not supported due to execution model differences. |
| **EVM `delegatecall` to EraVM** | ❌ | Not supported due to execution model differences. |
| **Out-of-ergs handling** | ⚠️ | EVM contracts revert **all EVM calls** on out-of-ergs errors. EraVM contracts revert only their local execution. |
