## EVM Bytecode Interpreter

ZKsync chains like Era operate on **EraVM**, a ZK-optimized virtual machine that differs from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
in its instruction set and execution model. While Solidity and Vyper can be compiled to EraVM bytecode, differences in
execution and tooling have required modifications in some cases.

To address this, ZKsync introduces **EVM execution mode via an EVM Bytecode Interpreter**, allowing **unmodified EVM bytecode** to run
on ZKsync chains **without recompilation or changes to developer tooling**. This enables projects built for Ethereum to execute in
ZKsync while maintaining EraVM as the core execution environment.

## Execution Model

- **EraVM remains the primary execution environment.** The EVM Interpreter does not replace EraVM but acts as a **translation layer**,
  enabling the execution of EVM bytecode on top of EraVM.
- **EVM contracts are flagged for interpretation.** When an EVM contract is deployed, its bytecode hash is marked with a special identifier.
  Instead of running native EraVM bytecode, the system routes execution through the interpreter.
- **EVM opcodes are interpreted at runtime.** The interpreter translates EVM instructions into **EraVM operations**, ensuring execution
  adheres to EVM semantics as closely as possible.
- **EVM gas accounting is interpreted.** Actual cost for underlying execution is paid in native EraVM gas.
  See **[EVM gas interpretation](./evm-gas-interpretation)** for details.

## Key Features

- **Deploy Solidity and Vyper contracts without recompilation.** No need to recompile with `zksolc` or `zkvyper`.
- **Compatible with standard Ethereum tooling.** Works with **Foundry, Hardhat, and Remix** without requiring additional plugins or modifications.
- **Consistent address derivation.** `create` and `create2` generate the same contract addresses as on Ethereum.
- **Pre-deployed system contracts.** Contracts such as `create2`, `multicall3`, and `singletonFactory (ERC2470)` are available
  for use. See **[Pre-Deployed Contracts](./pre-deployed-contracts)** for details.

## Tooling Support

The following table outlines the support status of various Ethereum development tools when used with the **EVM Bytecode Interpreter**.

| **Tool** | **Support** | **Notes** |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Remix** | ✅ Works (Deploy, Call, Send TX) | Debugging **not supported**. |
| **Foundry** | ✅ Works (`forge`, `cast`) | **Required:** For scripts use `--skip-simulation` due to gas calculation differences. |
| **Anvil** | ✅ Works | Forking from a chain with the EVM Interpreter works. **To use EraVM-specific features (i.e. EraVM contracts), [anvil-zksync is required](../../../zksync-era/tooling/local-setup/anvil-zksync-node)**. |
| **Hardhat** | ✅ Works | No ZKsync-specific plugins are required. |

## Developer Considerations

While the EVM Interpreter allows developers to deploy contracts using standard EVM bytecode, there are several important differences
compared to running contracts on Ethereum:

- **EVM gas model is interpreted on top of EraVM.** Actual transactions are paid in **ergs**, not EVM gas. EVM gas only exists inside of EVM environment.
  See **[EVM gas interpretation](./evm-gas-interpretation)** for details.
- **Opcode and feature limitations.** Some EVM opcodes (like `CALLCODE`, `SELFDESTRUCT` among others) are **not supported** due to
  EraVM constraints. A full list is available in **[EVM Differences](./evm-differences)**.
- **Higher transaction costs compared to native EraVM execution.** Due to opcode translation, fees may be **1.5x to 4x higher**
  than running native EraVM contracts.
- **`delegatecall` is not supported between EVM and EraVM contracts.** Learn more about **[EraVM ↔ EVM contract interactions](./era-evm-interactions)**.

Using the EVM Interpreter simplifies contract deployment for projects requiring **EVM bytecode compatibility**
but **EraVM-native contracts remain more efficient**.
Developers should consider using EraVM bytecode when possible for optimal performance.
