title: Instruction Reference

---

In this specification, instructions are grouped by their relevance to the EVM instruction set:

- [Native EVM instructions](instructions/evm).
- [Yul auxiliary instructions](instructions/yul).
- [EVM legacy assembly auxiliary instructions](instructions/evmla).

Most of the EVM native instructions are represented in both Yul and EVM legacy assembly IRs. If they are not, it is
stated explicitly in the description of each instruction.

## Addressing modes

EraVM is a register-based virtual machine with different addressing modes.
It overrides all stack mechanics described in [the official documentation of EVM opcodes](https://www.evm.codes/) including
errors they produce on EVM.

## Solidity Intermediate Representations (IRs)

Every instruction is translated via two IRs available in the Solidity compiler unless stated otherwise:

1. Yul
2. EVM legacy assembly

## Yul Extensions

ZKsync EraVM introduced a set of EraVM-specific instructions. The set is documented at [the official *zksolc* documentation](https://matter-labs.github.io/era-compiler-solidity/latest/).
