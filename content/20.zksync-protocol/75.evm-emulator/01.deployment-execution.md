title: EVM bytecode deployment and execution
description: General details about deploying and executing EVM contracts on ZKsync
---

The **EVM Bytecode Emulator** allows developers to deploy and execute **unmodified EVM contracts** on ZKsync
without requiring custom compilers. This section covers the **deployment process**, execution model, and key differences from standard EVM execution.

For a **deeper technical breakdown of how the emulator works**, including memory layout, gas management, and
returndata handling, see **[Technical Architecture of the EVM Emulator](./technical-details)**.

## Contract Deployment

EVM contracts can be deployed from EraVM using the **ContractDeployer** system contract:

| **Function** | **Equivalent to** |
|-------------|------------------|
| `createEVM` | `CREATE` |
| `create2EVM` | `CREATE2` |

### Address Derivation

- **Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs):** The contract address is derived using the **account nonce**.
- **Smart Contract Deployers:** The contract address is derived using the **deployment nonce**.

See the [NonceHolder system contract documentation](../contracts/system-contracts#nonceholder)
for more details.

### Deployment from an EVM Contract

EVM contracts **cannot** call `createEVM` or `create2EVM` directly, as they rely on **system calls**, which are restricted in the EVM environment.
Instead, the **EVM Emulator handles deployment internally** using:

- `precreateEvmAccountFromEmulator` – Ensures address derivation and performs collision checks.
- `createEvmFromEmulator` – Executes the deployment process.

For a breakdown of how the emulator handles EVM contract deployment internally, refer to
**[Technical Architecture of the EVM Emulator](./technical-details#contract-deployment-process)**.

## Execution Flow

1. **Versioned Hash Check:**
   - The system reads the **contract’s versioned hash** from `AccountCodeStorage`.
   - If the contract is an **EVM contract (`0x02`)**, the **EVM Emulator** is invoked.

2. **Bytecode Interpretation:**
   - The emulator loads the **contract’s bytecode** and **executes it** using EVM rules.

3. **Gas Handling:**
   - **Gas is accounted in EraVM gas units (ergs), not EVM gas.**
   - A **conversion ratio** is used to translate EVM gas to EraVM ergs.
   - Since EVM execution requires multiple EraVM instructions per opcode, the **effective cost is higher** than on Ethereum.

For a **detailed explanation of gas conversion, memory layout, and gas tracking**, see **[Technical Architecture of the EVM Emulator](./technical-details#gas-management)**.

## Special Considerations

- **Transactions with a null `to` address are supported.** This allows EOAs to deploy contracts similar to Ethereum.
- **Deployment failures increase the contract nonce.** This aligns with Ethereum but differs from EraVM, where failed deployments do not affect the nonce.
