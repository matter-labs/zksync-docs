title: EraVM ↔ EVM Contract Interactions
description:
---

EVM contracts and EraVM contracts can interact, but due to differences in execution models, some constraints exist.
The **EVM Emulator** ensures that EVM contracts execute in an environment that closely follows EVM semantics,
while EraVM contracts continue to operate natively.

This page covers the interaction rules, execution behavior, and limitations when calling between **EraVM and EVM contracts**.

## Calling an EVM Contract from an EraVM Contract

### Execution Flow

1. **EraVM contract makes a call** to an EVM contract.
2. The system reads the **versioned hash** of the target contract from `AccountCodeStorage`.
   - If the contract is **marked as an EVM contract** (`version 0x02`), the system redirects execution to the **EVM Emulator**.
3. The EVM Emulator:
   - Loads and interprets the EVM contract’s bytecode.
   - Executes the contract as if it were running on an EVM.
   - Returns the result in EraVM format.

### Gas Handling

- **EraVM contracts use ergs (EraVM gas).**
- When calling an EVM contract, **gas is converted** to an EVM-equivalent amount using a fixed ratio.
- Since each EVM opcode requires multiple EraVM instructions, the **effective cost is higher** than on Ethereum.

### Data Handling

- **Calldata is passed as-is.** EraVM contracts do not need to modify the calldata when calling an EVM contract.
- **Returned data is forwarded directly** without modifications.

## Calling an EraVM Contract from an EVM Contract

### Execution Flow

1. **EVM contract calls an EraVM contract.**
2. The system detects that the target contract has an **EraVM-native versioned hash (`0x01`)**.
3. The system executes the contract using the **EraVM execution model**.

### Gas Handling

- **The EVM contract's gas is converted to ergs** using a fixed ratio.
- The call proceeds as a **native EraVM call** with the converted gas amount.

## Execution Constraints

### `delegatecall` Is Not Supported Between EVM and EraVM Contracts

- **EVM contracts cannot use `delegatecall` to EraVM contracts.**
- **EraVM contracts cannot use `delegatecall` to EVM contracts.**
- This restriction prevents unintended access to system-level features and ensures execution isolation.

### Gas Limit Differences

- **EVM contracts have no forced call stack depth limit.** The 63/64 gas forwarding rule implicitly enforces a depth limitation.
- **EraVM contracts follow their own stack depth rules.**

### Out-of-Ergs Handling

- If an **EVM contract runs out of ergs**, it triggers an internal panic that **reverts the entire EVM call stack**.
- If an **EraVM contract runs out of ergs**, the failure propagates only to that contract’s execution context.

## Summary

| **Scenario** | **Supported?** | **Notes** |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **EraVM → EVM call** | ✅ | Calls are routed through the EVM Emulator. Gas is converted to EVM-equivalent values. |
| **EVM → EraVM call** | ✅ | Calls execute using native EraVM logic with gas conversion. |
| **EraVM `delegatecall` to EVM** | ❌ | Not supported due to execution model differences. |
| **EVM `delegatecall` to EraVM** | ❌ | Not supported due to execution model differences. |
| **EraVM call to EVM with returndata** | ✅ | Returndata is passed directly. |
| **EVM call to EraVM with returndata** | ✅ | Returndata is passed directly. |
| **Out-of-ergs handling** | ⚠️ | EVM contracts revert **all EVM calls** on out-of-ergs errors. EraVM contracts revert only their local execution. |
