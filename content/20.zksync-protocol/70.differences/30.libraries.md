We rely on the **solc** optimizer for library inlining, so a library may only be used without deployment
if it has been inlined by the optimizer.

The addresses of deployed libraries must be set in the project configuration. These addresses then replace their placeholders
in IRs: `linkersymbol` in Yul and `PUSHLIB` in EVM legacy assembly.

All linking happens at compile-time. Deploy-time linking is not supported.

For compiling non-linkable libraries please refer to the documentation [here](/zksync-network/tooling/hardhat/guides/compiling-libraries).
