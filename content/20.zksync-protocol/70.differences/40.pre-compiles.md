title: Precompiles
description:
---

Some EVM cryptographic precompiles (notably RSA / `modExp`) aren't currently available.
However other cryptographic primitives like `ecrecover`, `keccak256`, `sha256`, `ecadd` and `ecmul` are supported as precompiles.
No actions are required from your side as all the calls to the precompiles are done by the compilers under the hood.

It's important to be aware that the gas costs and behaviors of these precompiles when invoked via delegatecall may differ from those on Ethereum.

## Available precompiles

| Address | Name | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
|  `0x01` | ecRecover  | Recovers the public key from an ECDSA signature.           |
|  `0x02` | SHA2-256   | Computes the SHA-256 hash of the input.            |
|  `0x04` | identity   | Returns the input data unchanged            |
|  `0x06` | ecAdd      | Point addition (ADD) on the elliptic curve 'alt_bn128' .          |
|  `0x07` | ecMul      | Scalar multiplication (MUL) on the elliptic curve 'alt_bn128'.           |
|  `0x08` | ecParing   | Bilinear function on groups on the elliptic curve 'alt_bn128' .           |
| `0x100` | p256Verify | Performs signature verifications in the secp256r1 elliptic curve ([RIP7212](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs/blob/master/RIPS/rip-7212.md))            |
