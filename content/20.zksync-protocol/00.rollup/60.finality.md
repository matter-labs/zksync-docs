title: Finality
description: "Explore the concept of finality in blockchain systems and learn about the steps involved in achieving transaction settlement."
---

Finality in blockchain systems refers to the point at which a transaction is considered irreversible and permanently part of the blockchain.
This concept is crucial for ensuring transaction security and reliability.

## Finality on Ethereum

On Ethereum, finality is typically achieved after 2 [epochs](https://info.etherscan.com/epoch-in-ethereum/),
which translates to approximately 13 minutes under normal network conditions.
This duration allows for sufficient block confirmations to prevent reversals and ensure that transactions are settled securely.

## Finality on ZKsync Chains

ZKsync Chains, as a Layer 2s, tie their finality and security mechanisms to those of the underlying Layer 1, Ethereum.
The steps involved in reaching finality in ZKsync Chains include:

1. **Batch Formation**: Transactions are collected and grouped into a batch. This step generally takes a few minutes.
2. **Batch Commitment**: The complete batch is committed to the Ethereum blockchain.
3. **Proof Generation**: A cryptographic proof that validates the entire batch is generated. This process typically takes about an hour.
4. **Proof Submission**: The generated proof is submitted to an Ethereum smart contract for verification.
5. **Batch Finalization**: The batch undergoes a final verification and is settled on Ethereum.
  This step includes [a delay of approximately 3 hours as a security measure](https://forum.zknation.io/t/zip-4-reduce-the-execution-delay-from-21-hours-to-3-hours/373).

Overall, the complete finality time for a transaction on ZKsync Chains is around 3 hours, aligning with the finality of the corresponding Ethereum block.

Some ZKsync Chains may use [ZKsync Gateway](../gateway/overview) as a shared proof aggregation layer.
In those cases, finality includes an additional aggregation step before Ethereum verification, which may slightly adjust timing characteristics.

## Instant confirmations

While the full finality process on ZKsync Chains can take a few hours, transactions are treated with instant confirmation for user convenience:

- **Immediate Transaction Display**: Once submitted, transactions are quickly shown in the user interface and API as unconfirmed.
- **Immediate Asset Usability**: Users can immediately utilize the transferred assets for further transactions,
  which may even be included in the same ZKsync Chain batch.

This feature enables a seamless user experience,
although more cautious users may opt to wait for the transaction to reach full finality
or pass any intermediate steps before fully trusting the transaction's completion.
