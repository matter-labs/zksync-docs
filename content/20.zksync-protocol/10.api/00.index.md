description: Explore the comprehensive guide to the ZKsync JSON-RPC API, offering seamless Ethereum integration and advanced Layer 2 functionalities for developers.
---

This page provides you with a high-level overview of our API capabilities and essential information.

ZKsync seamlessly integrates with the Ethereum ecosystem. To achieve this integration,
we support not only the standard <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/" target="_blank">Ethereum JSON-RPC API</a>
but also introduce L2-specific features that enhance functionality.

ZKsync supports RPC providers that comply with the
official <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/" target="_blank">Ethereum JSON-RPC API</a> specification.
You can explore a comprehensive list of supported RPC providers in our [RPC ecosystem page](/zksync-era/ecosystem/node-providers).

To ensure a seamless experience, we impose rate limits on both HTTPS and WebSocket APIs.
Generally, these limits are ample, ranging from 10 to 100 requests per second (RPS) per client.
