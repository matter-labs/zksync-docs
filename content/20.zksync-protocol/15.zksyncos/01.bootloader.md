title: Bootloader
description: Learn about Bootloader, the entrypoint of the system
---

The bootloader is the component responsible for implementing the general blockchain protocol. Roughly, this means:

1. Initializing the system.
2. Reading the block context from the oracle.
3. Reading and parsing the first transaction.
4. Validating the transaction.
5. Executing the transaction.
6. Saving the transaction result.
7. Repeat from 3 until there are no more transactions.
8. Finalizing the block.

This component is, as the name suggest, the entrypoint of the system.
The function  [`run_prepared`](https://github.com/matter-labs/zk_ee/blob/main/basic_bootloader/src/bootloader/mod.rs) implements this
top-level main loop.

### Configuration

The bootloader can be configured with the following parameters
(found in the [`BasicBootloaderExecutionConfig`](https://github.com/matter-labs/zk_ee/blob/main/basic_bootloader/src/bootloader/config.rs) struct):

- `ONLY_SIMULATE`: skips the [validation](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/tx-processing#validation) step
when processing a transaction. Used for call simulation in the node.
- `IS_PROVING_ENVIRONMENT`: to skip some checks during sequencing.
- `SPECIAL_ADDRESS_SPACE_BOUND`: the range of address (starting from 0) where system contracts can be deployed.
- `AA_ENABLED`: whether native account abstraction is enabled.

In addition, the `basic_bootloader` crate has the following compilation flags:

- `code_in_kernel_space`: to enable normal contract execution for addresses in the range `[0, SPECIAL_ADDRESS_SPACE_BOUND]`.
- `transfers_to_kernel_space`: to enable token transfers to addresses in the range `[0, SPECIAL_ADDRESS_SPACE_BOUND]`. Note: the bootloader itself
has a special formal address (0x8001) that is always allowed to receive token transfers. This is used to collect fees.
- `charge_priority_fee`: to enable charging for the EIP-1559 tip (priority fee) on top of the base fee.
- `evm-compatibility`: enables all the previous flags, needed for the EVM test suite.

### Account Abstraction

Transaction validation and execution is done through an
abstract [account model](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/tx-processing#account-models). This is because BoojumOS supports
native account abstraction (AA) and paymasters, if enabled in the previously mentioned configuration. Native AA is designed to be backwards
compatible with the one used in [Era](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/unique-features/account-abstraction). More details about the account models
can be found in this [section](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/tx-processing).

### Code Execution

For transaction execution (and AA validation), the bootloader has to execute some contract code. This contract code corresponds to one of the
supported VMs, and is executed through the
[Execution Environment (EE)](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/execution-environment) module.

A contract call is executed through an interplay between the bootloader and (potentially different) execution environments. Indeed, a contract
executing in a given EE can call to contracts that run on a different EE or to
a [System Hook](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/hooks-flows#system-hooks). This interplay is described
under [Runner Flow](/zksync-protocol/zksyncos/hooks-flows#runner-flow).

### Block Header

At the end of the execution the bootloader outputs the block header.

For the block header, the Ethereum format will be used. However, some of the fields will be set differently in the first version for simplification.

The block header should determine the block fully, i.e. include all the inputs needed to execute the block.
