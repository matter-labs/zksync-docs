title: Processing of Transactions
description: Learn how transactions are processed
---

This section describes how transactions are processed. There are 2 flows of transaction processing, one for L1 transactions and one for L2
transactions. We'll describe the latter first and section **L1 -> L2 transactions** will explain the differences in the former.

1. **Parsing**: The transaction is parsed to extract its details.
2. **Resource Calculation**: The bootloader computes the transaction's resource usage, including gas limits and intrinsic costs.
3. **Account Model Interaction**: The appropriate account model (`EOA` or `Contract`) is selected for transaction processing.
4. **Nonce Validation**: The bootloader ensures the transaction's nonce is unused.
5. **Fee Charging**: The required transaction fees are calculated and deducted.
6. **Paymaster Handling**: If a paymaster is declared, its validation and payment methods are invoked.
7. **Execution**: The transaction is executed, either as a call or a deployment.
8. **Refunding**: Unused resources are refunded, with additional steps for paymasters if applicable.

## Resources
Transaction processing starts with the parsing of the transaction.

After parsing the transaction, the bootloader computes how many resources the transaction can spend. This resource calculation involves taking the
transaction's gas limit, checking it's bounded by the block's gas limit and subtracting calldata and intrinsic gas costs.

## Account Models

Before continuing to describe the processing of transactions, we need to introduce a key abstraction in this module: `Account models`. This
interface is a layer around Era's IAccount interface for [Account Abstraction](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-protocol/account-abstraction).

This interface provides methods for validating a transaction, executing it, checking nonces, paying for the transaction and preparing for the
paymaster. There are two implementations for it:

- `EOA`: the bootloader implements the interface directly, as Ethereum would process a transaction initiated from an EOA. Most of the system work
required here (except for signature verification) is not charged, as it's already included in the intrinsic cost.
- `Contract`: a wrapper to actual contract calls to contract accounts. Only allowed if AA is enabled.

## Validation

The first step of validation done by the bootloader is checking that the nonce is not used. This is done by calling the corresponding account
model method. For EOA, we use incremental nonces like the ones in Ethereum. Note that for this operation, and many like it, the bootloader needs
to access the storage through the System.

Then the account model validation method is called. For EOA, this performs the balance check for the token transfer, signature verification,
and nonce increase. After this, the bootloader checks if the nonce has been used (note that for EOA this step is a no-op, but it has to
be included for contract accounts).

The next step is charging the fees. This involves computing the required funds (`gas_price * gas_limit`), calling the account model's payment
method, and checking that the bootloader actually received the expected funds at its formal address. If it received more than expected,
it returns the excessive funds.

### Paymaster

If the transaction declared a paymaster (and AA is enabled) the last step described is slightly modified. Instead of calling the account's payment
method, the bootloader calls the account's paymaster preparation method. After that, it calls the paymaster's validation and payment method and
stores the paymaster context. In this case, any excessive funds are returned to the paymaster.

### Pubdata Considerations

ZKsync OS has to publish some data to the settlement layer to ensure the rollup's state can be recovered at any time.
This what we call ["pubdata"](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-protocol/contracts/handling-pubdata), and includes state diffs after a block
application and some required preimages. Given that making this data available costs money, we need to ensure that a transaction has enough
resources to pay for its share of pubdata. Thus, the final step of validation is charging for the pubdata size produced after validation.

## Execution

Validation can fail for a number of different reasons, detailed in the `InvalidTransaction` type in the Errors module.
It it succeeds, the bootloader proceeds to execute the transaction.

This step is straightforward: the bootloader simply calls the account mode's execution method.

For EOA, this consists of determining whether it's a normal call or a deployment. In the first case, the call is processed by
the `run_single_interaction` helper. In the case of deployment, the bootloader will charge some extra intrinsic gas and perform the check on the
init code size. After this, the deployment is processed with a call to `run_till_completion.`

After transaction execution, the bootloader checks if there are enough resources left for pubdata.

## Refunding the caller

The last step in the transaction processing is the refund of unused resources. In case of paymaster, the bootloader calls its `post_op` method
before the refund.

## Lifecycle of a transaction in the bootloader

To summarize, the lifecycle of an L2 transaction can be visualized as follows:

## L1 -> L2 transactions

The main difference in the processing of L1 transactions is that there is no validation step. The value for this transaction is minted, as those
funds are now locked in the L1 bridge. For now, deployment transactions from L1 transactions are not supported.
