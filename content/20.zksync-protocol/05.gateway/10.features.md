ZKsync Gateway serves as a settlement layer for ZK chains, focusing on proof aggregation, interoperability, and cost efficiency.
This section describes its key technical features.

## Proof Aggregation

ZKsync Gateway aggregates proofs generated by multiple chains into a single proof. This aggregated proof is then submitted to Ethereum for final
verification, reducing the number of proof verification operations required on Layer 1 and lowering associated gas costs.
Participating chains benefit from more predictable and reduced settlement costs, while maintaining the security guarantees of Ethereum.
The aggregation mechanism becomes more efficient as the number of chains settling on Gateway increases.

## Interoperability

Gateway provides a shared settlement layer that enables participating chains to communicate with each other.
Chains settling on Gateway can exchange messages directly, which can simplify the design of cross-chain systems.
Communication between Gateway-based chains follows standardized mechanisms, while interactions with Ethereum or chains not using Gateway continue to
use established bridging protocols. This setup helps reduce the complexity of interchain communication for chains opting into Gateway.

## Cost Efficiency

Chains settling on ZKsync Gateway reduce their operational costs by taking advantage of proof aggregation and avoiding the high and variable gas costs
of direct Ethereum settlement. Settlement fees for submitting proofs to Gateway are paid in **$ZK** tokens, providing a predictable cost structure.

## Finality

When a chain settles on Gateway, proof aggregation introduces an additional step before final verification on Ethereum. This can result in slightly
longer finality times compared to chains settling directly on Ethereum. However, interoperability finality between Gateway-based chains may be faster,
as interactions can be completed once the proof is verified on Gateway rather than waiting for full Ethereum settlement.
Chains considering Gateway should weigh the trade-offs between reduced costs, improved interoperability, and finality requirements.
