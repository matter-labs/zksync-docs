ZKsync Gateway is an **optional settlement layer** for ZK chains, including both rollups and validiums. It is purpose-built to enhance **interoperability**,
provide **proof aggregation**, and offer **cost efficiencies** for chains that wish to settle on top of it.

As a **middleware** between ZK chains and Ethereum, ZKsync Gateway consolidates proofs generated by chains and submits them to Ethereum for final verification.
This design reduces gas costs, accelerates interchain communication, and improves the scalability of ZK ecosystems.

## Key Benefits

- **Interoperability**: Enables faster and more seamless communication between ZK chains settling on Gateway.
- **Proof Aggregation**: Reduces costs for users and chains by aggregating multiple proofs into a single proof submitted to Ethereum.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Offers stable pricing for proof verification compared to direct settlement on Ethereum.

## Governance

ZKsync Gateway was **whitelisted as a settlement layer** in the [ZIP-10 governance
proposal](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/zksync/proposal/97689115420129047109255183628089175185608660755000395855946331923921270505453?govId=eip155:324:0x76705327e682F2d96943280D99464Ab61219e34f).
This proposal allows chain operators to select ZKsync Gateway as their settlement layer in place of Ethereum.

**Migration to ZKsync Gateway is optional**, and operators can opt in and out at any time.

<!-- TODO: fix explorer URLs -->

| Environment | Chain ID | Gas Token | Explorer |
|-------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Testnet     | 506      | $ZK       | [Explorer](https://explorer.era-gateway-stage.zksync.dev/) |
| Mainnet     | 9075     | $ZK       | [Explorer](https://explorer.era-gateway-stage.zksync.dev/) |

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
ZKsync Gateway is intended as a **settlement layer and proof aggregation platform**, designed to facilitate fast interop and cost-efficient proof submission.
It is **not intended for developers to deploy custom smart contracts or applications**. Contract deployment on
Gateway requires **whitelisting** and is restricted to authorized accounts.
