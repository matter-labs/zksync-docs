This section addresses common questions about ZKsync Gateway, its usage, and its implications for ZK chains.

### Can chain operators move in and out of Gateway?

Yes. Migration to ZKsync Gateway as a settlement layer is optional and can be reversed if needed. Chains can
configure their settlement layer to switch between Ethereum and Gateway.

### Is there any impact on application developers building on a ZK chain that migrates to Gateway?

In most cases, no. Application developers continue to deploy their contracts on the ZK chain itself. Migration to Gateway does not
affect application-layer interactions. However, differences in bridging and finality may need to be considered.

### How does Gateway affect finality?

When a chain migrates to Gateway, the proof aggregation process introduces an additional layer before final verification on Ethereum.
This may increase finality times compared to direct settlement on Ethereum. Chains interacting with other Gateway-settling chains
may experience faster interoperability finality within the Gateway network.

### How are deposits and withdrawals from Ethereum to chains on Gateway handled?

Deposits and withdrawals are handled in the same way as for chains settling directly on Ethereum. APIs and helper methods
for `deposit` and `withdraw` in the ZKsync SDKs work the same for both settlement layers.

### How can I check if a chain is settling on Ethereum or Gateway?

You can use the `settlementLayer(chainId)` method on the
[BridgeHub contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x303a465B659cBB0ab36eE643eA362c509EEb5213#readProxyContract).
This method returns the settlement layer chain ID used by the specified chain:

- `1` for Ethereum Mainnet
- `9075` for ZKsync Gateway

### What fees are required to submit proofs to Gateway?

Settlement fees for submitting proofs to ZKsync Gateway are paid in **$ZK** tokens. Chain operators should plan accordingly based on their settlement volume.

### Can chains use custom data availability solutions with Gateway?

Yes. Chains using custom data availability layers must ensure their validation logic is compatible with Gateway and can be deployed
and executed on the Gateway settlement layer.

### Where can I find more information about migrating a chain to Gateway?

Detailed instructions are available in the [ZK Stack migration guide](../../zk-stack/running/gateway-settlement-layer)
