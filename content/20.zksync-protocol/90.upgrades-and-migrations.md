### September 2024

#### Governance Rights Upgrade

- Patched version 24.2.
- Transferred the authority for upgrades to ZKsync Nation onchain governance. Read more about how governance works in the [ZKsync Nation blog post](https://blog.zknation.io/zksync-governance-system/).

#### Shared Bridge Upgrade

- Patched version 24.2.
- Introduced a minor change to the BridgeHub contracts which allows the Admin role to add custom base tokens to the system.
Previously only the owner of the contract was able to do this.
The upgrade was a required step to distinguish the owner and admin role.

### August 2024

#### Shared Bridge Upgrade

- Patched version 24.2.
- Introduced an [admin role](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/pull/727/files) in the Shared Bridge contract
to advance toward decentralized governance.
- The admin is exclusively responsible for nominating L2 bridge counterparts for newly deployed chains.

#### Elastic Chain Upgrade

- Patched version 24.2.
- Introduced the new [`ChainAdmin` contract interface](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/pull/598/files), which has admin rights over:
  - ZKsync Era Diamond Proxy
  - BridgeHub
  - State Transition Manager
- `ChainAdmin` acts as a “sovereign” wrapper, allowing each ZKsync Chain to customize configurations like fee parameters and upgrade processes.
- The State Transition Manager (STM) contract now emits events with more detailed upgrade data accessible to other ZKsync Chains.
