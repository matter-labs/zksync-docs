`zksync2-swift` does not implement any new `Contract` class.

With ZKsync, you can deploy a contract using the `create` and `create2` methods,
by simply building the contract into a binary format and deploying it to the ZKsync network.

In order to pay for smart contract interactions in ERC20 tokens, `customData` override should be used.
You can read more about accessing ZKsync features in [the features chapter](/swift/guides/features).
