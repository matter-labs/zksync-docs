A Web3 provider object provides application-layer access to underlying blockchain networks.

The [`zksync2-swift`](https://github.com/zksync-sdk/zksync2-swift) library supports provider methods
from the [`web3swift`](https://github.com/web3swift-team/web3swift) library and supplies additional functionality.

Two providers are available:

- **[`ZkSyncClient`](/swift/api/clients/client#zksyncclient)**: Supplies the same functionality as `Web3` and
extends it with ZKsync-specific methods.

The `ZkSyncClient` component in `zksync2-swift` offers enhanced interaction capabilities with the ZKsync Era
blockchain. It provides methods to estimate transaction fees, gas requirements, and access to additional ZKsync-specific
information and functionalities, making it a powerful tool for developers working within the ZKsync ecosystem.
