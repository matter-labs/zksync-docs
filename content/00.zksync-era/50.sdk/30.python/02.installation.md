- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher. Download and install it from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Pip**: Version 23.1.2 or higher. Pip is the package installer for Python. Install it using the guide on the [Pip website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

## Adding dependencies

To add the ZKsync Era SDK to your project, follow these steps:

1. **Open your terminal**: Use any terminal or command line interface you like.

2. **Install the ZKsync Era SDK**: Run this command to install the SDK with pip:

   ```shell
   pip install zksync2
   ```

## Verification

Check if the installation was successful by importing the SDK in a Python script or an interactive Python session:

```python
import importlib.metadata

zksync_version = importlib.metadata.version("zksync2")
print("ZKsync SDK version:", zksync_version)
```

You should see a response like:

```sh
