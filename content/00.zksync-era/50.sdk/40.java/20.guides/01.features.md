While ZKsync is mostly Web3-compatible, it has some differences compared to Ethereum. The major of those are:

- Account abstraction support (accounts may have near-arbitrary validation logic, and also paymaster support is enabled).
- Deployment transactions require the contracts' bytecode to be passed in a separate field.
- The fee system is somewhat different.

These require us to extend standard Ethereum transactions with new custom fields.
Such extended transactions are called EIP712 transactions since [EIP712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712)
is used to sign them. You can look at the internal structure of the [EIP712 transactions](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/concepts/transaction-lifecycle#eip-712-0x71).

This document will focus solely on how to pass these arguments to the SDK.

## Encoding paymaster params

While the paymaster feature by itself does not impose any limitations on values of the `paymasterInput`,
the Matter Labs team endorses certain types of
[paymaster flows](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/account-abstraction/paymasters#built-in-paymaster-flows)
that are processable by EOAs.

ZKsync SDK provides a utility method that can be used to get the correctly formed `paymasterParams` object:
[approvalBased](/java/api/utilities/paymaster-utils#encodeapprovalbased), [general](/java/api/utilities/paymaster-utils#encodegeneral).
