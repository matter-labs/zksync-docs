title: L1<->L2 Transactions
description: Methods for handling transactions between L1 and L2 networks on ZKsync
tags: ["zksync", "l1", "l2", "transactions", "java", "sdk"]
---

This section explores the methods which allow the [account](/java/api/accounts/wallet) to send transactions
among both L1 to L2 networks.

If you want some background on how L1<->L2 interaction works on ZKsync, go through the
[introduction](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/l1-l2-interoperability).

## Deposit

`Wallet` and `L1Signer` objects provide a deposit workflow.
For more information, please refer to the method specification [`Deposit`](/java/api/accounts/wallet#deposit).

For a complete example of how to execute the deposit workflow, take a look at the following:
Deposit ETH and ERC20 token

::collapsible

  ```bash
import { Provider, types, utils, Wallet } from "zksync-ethers";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const provider = Provider.getDefaultProvider(types.Network.Sepolia);
const ethProvider = ethers.getDefaultProvider("sepolia");
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
const wallet = new Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider, ethProvider);

async function main() {
    console.log(`L2 balance before deposit: ${await wallet.getBalance()}`);
    console.log(`L1 balance before deposit: ${await wallet.getBalanceL1()}`);

    const tx = await wallet.deposit({
        token: utils.ETH_ADDRESS,
        to: await wallet.getAddress(),
        amount: ethers.parseEther("0.00020"),
        refundRecipient: await wallet.getAddress(),
    });
    const receipt = await tx.wait();
    console.log(`Tx: ${receipt.hash}`);

    console.log(`L2 balance after deposit: ${await wallet.getBalance()}`);
    console.log(`L1 balance after deposit: ${await wallet.getBalanceL1()}`);
}

main()
    .then()
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log(`Error: ${error}`);
    });

## Request execute

`Wallet` and `L1Signer` objects provide an option to request execution of L2 transaction from L1.
For more information, please refer to the method specification [`requestExecute`](/java/api/accounts/wallet#requestexecute).

## Base cost

`Wallet` and `L1Signer` objects provide an option to calculate base cost for L2 transaction.
For more information, please refer to the method specification [`getBaseCost`](/java/api/accounts/wallet#getbasecost).

## Withdrawal

`Wallet` and `Signer` objects provide a withdrawal workflow.
For more information, please refer to the method specification [`Deposit`](/java/api/accounts/wallet#deposit).

For a complete example of how to execute the deposit workflow, take a look at the following:
Withdraw ETH and ERC20 token

::collapsible
  ```bash
import { Provider, types, utils, Wallet } from "zksync-ethers";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const provider = Provider.getDefaultProvider(types.Network.Sepolia);
const ethProvider = ethers.getDefaultProvider("sepolia");
const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
const wallet = new Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, provider, ethProvider);

async function main() {
    console.log(`L2 balance before withdraw: ${await wallet.getBalance()}`);
    console.log(`L1 balance before withdraw: ${await wallet.getBalanceL1()}`);

    const tx = await wallet.withdraw({
        token: utils.ETH_ADDRESS,
        to: await wallet.getAddress(),
        amount: ethers.parseEther("0.00020"),
    });
    const receipt = await tx.wait();
    console.log(`Tx: ${receipt.hash}`);

    // The duration for submitting a withdrawal transaction to L1 can last up to 24 hours. For additional information,
    // please refer to the documentation: https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/troubleshooting/withdrawal-delay.html.
    // Once the withdrawal transaction is submitted on L1, it needs to be finalized.
    // To learn more about how to achieve this, please take a look at the 04_finalize_withdraw.ts script.
}

main()
    .then()
    .catch((error) => {
        console.log(`Error: ${error}`);
    });
