## What is ZKsync Era SDKs?

**ZKsync Era SDKs** are tools that help developers build decentralized applications (dApps) for the ZKsync Era network.

**ZKsync Era** is a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum. It uses a special technology called **ZK rollup**. This technology
makes transactions faster and cheaper while keeping the security and trust of the Ethereum blockchain.

### Key points

- **ZKsync Era SDK**: Toolkits for developers to easily create dApps on ZKsync Era.
- **ZKsync Era Network**: Enhances Ethereum transactions, making them quicker and less expensive.
- **ZK Rollup Technology**: Bundles multiple transactions into one, ensuring speed, cost-efficiency, and security.
- **ZKsync Sepolia Explorer**: A block explorer specifically for the ZKsync Era on the Sepolia testnet.

## Benefits of ZKsync Era SDKs

These SDKs, available in various programming languages, streamline the process of building decentralized applications
(dApps) that leverage ZKsync Era's benefits, including:

- **Scalability**: Massively reduced transaction fees and faster confirmation times compared to Ethereum.
- **Security**: Inherits security from the underlying Ethereum blockchain.
- **Enhanced user experience**: Enables smoother and more cost-effective dApp interactions for users.
- **Paymaster support**: Enables flexible transaction fee payment strategies:
  - Third-party services can cover fees for users, fostering wider adoption.
  - Gasless transactions become possible, improving user experience.
- **Account abstraction**:
  - Enhances security and privacy by separating user accounts from keys.
  - Improves developer experience by simplifying account management and enabling features like multi-signature wallets
    and on-chain governance.
