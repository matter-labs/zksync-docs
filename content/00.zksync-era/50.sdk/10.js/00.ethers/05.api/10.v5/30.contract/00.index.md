`zksync-ethers` does not implement any new `Contract` class, since `ethers.Contract` fully works out of the box.
However, for convenience, the library still re-exports this class.

Since deploying smart contracts on ZKsync has some differences from deploying on Ethereum, there is a need for
a specific `ContractFactory` method. It supports the same interface as `ethers.ContractFactory`.

In order to pay for smart contract interactions in ERC20 tokens, `customData` override should be used.
You can read more about accessing ZKsync features in [ZKsync Era features](/js/ethers/guides/features).
