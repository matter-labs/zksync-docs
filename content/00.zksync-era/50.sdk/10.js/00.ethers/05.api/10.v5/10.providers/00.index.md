A Provider interacts with the blockchain network, allowing applications to send transactions, query data, and
listen to events. Providers bridge the application and blockchain, ensuring smooth communication.

The [`zksync-ethers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zksync-ethers/v/5.0.0) library supports providers from
the [`ethers.js`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers) library and adds extra functionality.

Two providers are available:

- [`Provider`](/js/ethers/api/v5/providers/web3provider): Functions
like [`ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider`](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/api/providers/jsonrpc-provider/#JsonRpcProvider)
with added ZKsync-specific methods.
- [`Web3Provider`](/js/ethers/api/v5/providers/web3provider): Extends the ZKsync
Era [`Provider`](/js/ethers/api/v5/providers/provider) class for better compatibility with Web3 wallets.

Use the [`Web3Provider`](/js/ethers/api/v5/providers/web3provider) for browser integrations.

### `Provider`

The `Provider` class in the `zksync-ethers` library extends the `ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider` with additional
ZKsync-specific methods. This lets users access advanced ZKsync features using the familiar `ethers.js` interface.

### `Web3Provider`

The `Web3Provider` class extends the ZKsync Era `Provider` class for better compatibility with Web3 wallets, making it
ideal for browser-based integrations. This provider ensures seamless interaction with wallet extensions like MetaMask,
allowing users to manage accounts and sign transactions directly from the browser.
