A Provider interacts with the blockchain network, allowing applications to send transactions, query data, and
listen to events. Providers bridge the application and blockchain, ensuring smooth communication.

The [`zksync-ethers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zksync-ethers/v/5.0.0) library supports providers from
the [`ethers.js`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/providers) library and adds extra functionality.

Two providers are available:

- **Provider**: Extends
[`ethers.JsonRpcProvider`](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/api/providers/jsonrpc/#about-jsonrpcProvider) with ZKsync-specific
methods.
- **BrowserProvider**: Extends the ZKsync Era `Provider` class for better compatibility with Web3 wallets.

### `Provider`

The `Provider` class in `zksync-ethers` library extends the `ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider` with additional
ZKsync-specific methods. This lets users leverage the familiar ethers.js interface while accessing advanced features
specific to ZKsync.

### `BrowserProvider`

The `BrowserProvider` class extends the ZKsync Era `Provider` class to offer enhanced compatibility with Web3 wallets,
making it ideal for browser-based integrations. This provider ensures seamless interaction with wallet extensions like
MetaMask, enabling users to manage their accounts and sign transactions directly from the browser.
