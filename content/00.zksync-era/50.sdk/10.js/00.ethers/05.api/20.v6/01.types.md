tags: ["zksync", "types", "interfaces", "ethereum", "blockchain"]
---

These types and interfaces are essential for developers working with the ZKsync blockchain, as they define the
structures and enumerations for different components of the system.

## `AccountAbstractionVersion`

Enumerated list of account abstraction versions.

::collapsible

- None = `0` - Used for contracts that are not accounts.
- Version1 = `1` - Used for contracts that are accounts.
::

## `AccountNonceOrdering`

Enumerated list of account nonce ordering formats.

::collapsible

- Sequential = `0` - Nonces should be ordered in the same way as in externally owned accounts (EOAs).
  This means, for instance, that the operator will always wait for a transaction with nonce `X`
  before processing a transaction with nonce `X+1`.
- Arbitrary = `1` - Nonces can be ordered in arbitrary order.
