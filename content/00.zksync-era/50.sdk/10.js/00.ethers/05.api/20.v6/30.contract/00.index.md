The `zksync-ethers` library leverages the existing `ethers.Contract` class for smart contract management, ensuring
full compatibility out of the box. For convenience, this class is re-exported within the library.

## Deploying smart contracts

Deploying smart contracts on ZKsync differs slightly from Ethereum. To accommodate these differences, a
specific `ContractFactory` method is provided. This method supports the same interface as `ethers.ContractFactory`.

### ContractFactory

The `ContractFactory` method facilitates the deployment of smart contracts on the ZKsync network. This method is
essential due to the unique requirements of deploying contracts on ZKsync compared to Ethereum.

### Paying with ERC20 tokens

To pay for smart contract interactions using ERC20 tokens, the `customData` override should be utilized. This
feature allows for more flexible payment options within the ZKsync network.
