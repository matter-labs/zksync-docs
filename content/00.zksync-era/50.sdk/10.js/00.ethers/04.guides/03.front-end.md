Learn how to integrate ZKsync Era into your front-end for the best user experience.

## Immediate production deployment

You don't need to change your codebase if your front-end does not deploy new smart contracts! All existing SDKs and
infrastructure will work seamlessly.

## Using ZKsync Era features

To deploy smart contracts or use advanced zksync features like account abstraction, you'll need the `zksync-ethers`
library. Learn the basics of `zksync-ethers` in the [ZKsync Era Features](/js/ethers/guides/features).
