ZKsync Era offers several unique features compared to Ethereum, requiring specific handling. This guide will help
you understand these differences and how to work with them using the `zksync-ethers` library.

## Key differences

- **Account abstraction**: ZKsync supports account abstraction, allowing accounts to have custom validation logic and
enabling paymaster support.
- **Deployment transactions**: Contracts on ZKsync require bytecode to be passed in a separate field during deployment.
- **Fee system**: The fee system in ZKsync differs from Ethereum's, necessitating additional transaction fields.

These differences require extending standard Ethereum transactions with new custom fields. Such extended transactions
are called EIP712 transactions since [EIP712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) is used to sign them. More
details on EIP712 transactions can be found in the [ZKstack transaction lifecycle](https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/concepts/transaction-lifecycle#eip-712-0x71).

## Overrides in transactions

`ethers.js` has a notion of overrides. For any on-chain transaction, `ethers.js` finds the
optimal `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`, `nonce`, and other important fields under the hood. But sometimes, you may need to
explicitly provide these values (e.g., setting a smaller `gasPrice` or signing a transaction with a future `nonce`).

In such cases, you can use an `Overrides` object as the last parameter. This object lets you set fields
like `gasPrice`, `gasLimit`, `nonce`, etc.

To make the SDK as flexible as possible, `zksync-ethers` uses a `customData` object within the overrides to supply
ZKsync-specific fields. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
const tx = {
  to: '0x...',
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther('0.01'),
  overrides: {
    gasPrice: ethers.utils.parseUnits('10', 'gwei'),
    gasLimit: 21000,
    nonce: 0,
    customData: {
      gasPerPubdata: BigNumberish,
      factoryDeps: BytesLike[],
      customSignature: BytesLike,
      paymasterParams: {
        paymaster: Address,
        paymasterInput: BytesLike
      }
    }
  }
};
```

### CustomData fields

- `gasPerPubdata`: Specifies L2 gas per published byte.
- `factoryDeps`: Array of contract bytecodes for deployment.
- `customSignature`: Custom signature for the transaction.
- `paymasterParams`: Parameters for using a paymaster.

Everything inside `customData` in `overrides` is related to ZKsync (L2 gas, etc.).

### Example overrides

To deploy a contract with specific bytecode and a gas limit for published data:

```typescript
{
    customData: {
        gasPerPubdata: "100",
        factoryDeps: ["0xcde...12"],
    }
}
```

To use a custom signature and paymaster:

```typescript
{
    customData: {
        customSignature: "0x123456",
        paymasterParams: {
            paymaster: "0x8e1DC7E4Bb15927E76a854a92Bf8053761501fdC",
            paymasterInput: "0x8c5a3445"
        }
    }
}
```

## Encoding paymaster params

While the paymaster feature by itself does not impose any limitations on values of the `paymasterInput`, the Matter
Labs team endorses certain types
of [paymaster flows](https://docs.zksync.io/build/developer-reference/account-abstraction.html#built-in-paymaster-flows)
that are processable by EOAs.

The ZKsync SDK provides a utility method that can be used to get the correctly formed `paymasterParams` object:

```typescript
const paymasterParams = utils.getPaymasterParams(testnetPaymaster, {
  type: "ApprovalBased",
  token,
  minimalAllowance: fee,
  innerInput: new Uint8Array(),
});
```

## Using a paymaster with a contract method

Here is how you can call the `setGreeting` method of a `Contract` object `greeter` and pay fees with a testnet paymaster:

```typescript
const greeting = "a new greeting";
const tx = await greeter.populateTransaction.setGreeting(greeting);
const gasPrice = await sender.provider.getGasPrice();
const gasLimit = await greeter.estimateGas.setGreeting(greeting);
const fee = gasPrice.mul(gasLimit);

const paymasterParams = utils.getPaymasterParams(testnetPaymaster, {
  type: "ApprovalBased",
  token,
  minimalAllowance: fee,
  innerInput: new Uint8Array(),
});

const sentTx = await sender.sendTransaction({
  ...tx,
  maxFeePerGas: gasPrice,
  maxPriorityFeePerGas: 0n,
  gasLimit,
  customData: {
    gasPerPubdata: utils.DEFAULT_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT,
    paymasterParams,
  },
});
```
