`zksync-ethers` offers classes for signing ZKsync transactions:

- **`Wallet`**: Extends `ethers.Wallet` with ZKsync features.
- **`EIP712Signer`**: Signs `EIP712`-typed ZKsync transactions.
- **`Signer`**: For browser integration.
- **`L1Signer`**: For browser integration.
- **`VoidSigner`**: Uses addresses without signing credentials.
- **`L1VoidSigner`**: Uses addresses without signing credentials.
- **`SmartAccount`**: Supports account abstraction with factory classes:
  - **`ECDSASmartAccount`**: Uses a single ECDSA key.
  - **`MultisigECDSASmartAccount`**: Uses multiple ECDSA keys.

### Why use these classes?

They simplify ZKsync blockchain interactions by providing:

- **Security**: Securely manage private keys and sign transactions.
- **Convenience**: Easily create and manage accounts with advanced features.
- **Compatibility**: Extend `ethers.js` for seamless project integration.

### Classes

#### `Wallet`

The `Wallet` class extends `ethers.Wallet`, providing additional methods specific to ZKsync. It allows you to create
and manage wallets, sign transactions, and interact with the ZKsync network seamlessly.

#### `EIP712Signer`

The `EIP712Signer` class signs `EIP712`-typed ZKsync transactions, ensuring transactions comply with the EIP-712
standard for typed data.

#### `Signer`

The `Signer` class enables seamless interaction with web3 wallets like MetaMask, supporting ZKsync-specific operations.

#### `L1Signer`

The `L1Signer` class also supports browser integration for ZKsync-specific operations, similar to `Signer`.

#### `VoidSigner`

The `VoidSigner` class allows an address to be used in any API that accepts a `Signer`, without credentials for actual
signing. Useful for representing an account without exposing private keys.

#### `L1VoidSigner`

The `L1VoidSigner` class functions like `VoidSigner`, allowing address representation without signing credentials.

#### `SmartAccount`

The `SmartAccount` class provides better support for account abstraction, allowing for more advanced account
management features. Factory classes for `SmartAccount` include:

- **`ECDSASmartAccount`**: Uses a single ECDSA key for signing payloads.
- **`MultisigECDSASmartAccount`**: Uses multiple ECDSA keys for signing payloads.
