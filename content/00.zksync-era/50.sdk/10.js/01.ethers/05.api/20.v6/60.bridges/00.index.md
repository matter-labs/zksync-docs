The ZKsync Era SDK provides bridge objects to interact with ZKsync bridges and transfer assets between networks.

### Available Bridges

The SDK includes two main bridge implementations:

[`AbstractBridge`](./bridges/01.abstract-bridge.md): A foundational abstract class that provides core bridging functionality
and serves as a base for custom bridge implementations. It defines common deposit and withdrawal functionality shared across
different bridge types.

[`USDCBridge`](./bridges/02.usdc-bridge.md): A specialized implementation built on top of [`AbstractBridge`](./bridges/01.abstract-bridge.md),
designed specifically for USDC token transfers via the custom [USDC bridge](https://github.com/matter-labs/usdc-bridge).

Use [`AbstractBridge`](./bridges/01.abstract-bridge.md) as a foundation for custom bridges implementation or [`USDCBridge`](./bridges/02.usdc-bridge.md)
to interact with the custom [USDC bridge](https://github.com/matter-labs/usdc-bridge).
