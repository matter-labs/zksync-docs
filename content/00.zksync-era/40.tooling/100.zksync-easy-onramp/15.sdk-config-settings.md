title: SDK Config Settings
description: Get config data to use with your implementation of the SDK
---

The SDK provides an endpoint to get all of the configuration data to use for
building quotes. This includes the list of supported tokens, chains, and
services. This is useful for building a UI that allows users to select
different tokens and chains to use for their on-ramp experience.

## Get SDK config

This is not the same as the SDK configuration that you set when you initialize
the SDK. The `fetchConfig` is a separate endpoint that returns the configuration data for
the SDK.

```ts
import { fetchConfig,  } from "zksync-easy-onramp";

const config = await fetchConfig();
```

## Config data

The config data returned from the SDK includes the following:

- `tokens`: A list of all supported tokens for the SDK. This includes the token name,
  address, chainId, symbol, decimals, marketCap, usdPrice, and iconUrl.
- `chains`: A list of all supported chains for the SDK. This includes the chain
  ID, and name.
- `providers`: A list of all supported services for the SDK. This includes the
  service name, logo, type, and supported tokens.
- `fiatCurrencies`: A list of all supported fiat currencies for the SDK.
  This is an array of currency codes in string format.
