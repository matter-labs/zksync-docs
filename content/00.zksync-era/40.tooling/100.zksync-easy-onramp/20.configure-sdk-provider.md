The ZKsync Easy On-Ramp SDK uses the LI.FI SDK to handle any token swaps during an on-ramp process.
These token swaps require a wallet client, wallet adapter or a similar wallet interface to handle
transaction execution as well as a number of other wallet related tasks. To learn more about the
LI.FI SDK's handling of providers, learn more on their [Configure SDK
providers](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/configure-sdk-providers#setup-evm-provider). Since this SDK provides
on-ramping to ZKsync, we provide only the EVM Provider for configuration.

## Setup the EVM provider

Use the EVM provider from the ZKsync Easy On-Ramp SDK and pass that to the `provider` key in the
config initialization.

```ts
// Example from the Demo App
createOnRampConfig({
  integrator: "ZKsync Easy OnRamp Demo",
  provider: EVM({
    getWalletClient: async () => getWalletClient(wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig,),
    switchChain: async (chainId,) => {
      const chain = await switchChain(wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig, { chainId, },);
      return await getWalletClient(wagmiAdapter.wagmiConfig, { chainId: chain.id, },);
    },
  },),
  dev: true,
},);
```

To learn more about configuring the EVM provider, read [Setup EVM
Provider](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/configure-sdk-providers#setup-evm-provider) on the
LI.FI Documentation.
