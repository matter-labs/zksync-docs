description: Use sandbox environments to test your SDK integration
---

Service providers generally have a sandbox environment to test purchases and token swaps in a
non-production environment. However, one service we use, LI.FI does not have a testnet environment
available. Instead we create a "cheap" (around $0.25) transaction that swaps tokens from USDT to the chosen token
on the chain specified.

To use the sandbox environment, setup your sdk configuration with the `dev` flag set to true.

```ts
import { createOnRampConfig } from 'zksync-easy-onramp';

createOnRampConfig({
  integrator: "ZKsync Easy OnRamp Demo",
  dev: true
},);
```

## Service sandboxes

Each service may require additional configurations like mock KYC verification. Refer to their
documents for completing sandbox environment setup.
