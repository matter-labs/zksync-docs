description: Frequently asked questions about ZKsync Easy On-Ramp SDK.
---

## Is this open-source?

Yes. The SDK is MIT-licensed and available on GitHub. [View repo] (https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-easy-onramp).

## Is user KYC handled?

Yes. Regulated on-ramp providers (like Transak) handle KYC flows as part of the payment process. The SDK does not process or store any personal user data.

## Do I need to run any backend or server?

No. The SDK is fully hosted and can be integrated directly into your front-end.
No server setup is required unless you choose to manage provider API keys yourself.

## Can I limit which payment methods are available?

Yes. You can configure the SDK to allow only specific paymentMethods (e.g., Apple Pay, card, bank transfer).

## Do I need to complete KYB to integrate?

Only if the on-ramp provider requires it.
For example, Transak requires each integrator to complete a lightweight KYB process and obtain their own API key.
The process is expedited for ZKsync developers. [Start Here](https://transak.notion.site/onboard-zksync-with-transak).

## How do I enable new on-ramp partners supported by the SDK?

If a partner doesn’t require KYB or separate API key setup, no action is needed—quotes will appear automatically.
If KYB is required, follow the partner’s onboarding process to make their quotes available in your integration.

## What if I don’t want to show quotes from a specific provider?

You can exclude any partner from your integration by updating the provider exclusion list in your SDK configuration.
You’re always in control of what your users see.

## (For ZK Chains) When can I integrate this SDK into an app on another Elastic chain (not Era)?

You can integrate the SDK today, but fiat-to-token transactions will land on ZKsync Era initially.
Users can then manually bridge to your chain. Once native interop goes live (expected Q3 2025),
the SDK will automatically route funds directly to your chain—no changes needed on your end.

## (For ZK Chains) Do chains need separate deals with liquidity providers?

No. All fiat payment rails and liquidity are integrated into ZKsync Era. Once interop is live,
funds can move to your chain trustlessly—no separate integration or commercial agreement is needed.
