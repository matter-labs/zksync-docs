description: Quickly scaffold new projects using templates with ZKsync CLI create
---

The ZKsync CLI provides a helpful command to scaffold a project to develop smart contracts, dApps, and scripts for ZKsync.
The `create` command provides many templates to allow you to quickly start a project using
various available libraries and frameworks like Solidity, Vyper, Ethers, and Hardhat to name a few.

## Create a new project

To quickly setup a brand new project, navigate to a directory where you want to set up a new folder for your project.
In this example we will create a project to build smart contracts.
Run the following command:

```sh
zksync-cli create
```

The CLI prompts you with several questions to determine what template to setup for the new project.
A template will download and the dependencies will install using the selected package manager.

```sh
? Enter a folder name for your project: example-project
? What type of project do you want to create? Contracts
? Ethereum framework Ethers v6
? Template Hardhat + Solidity
? Private key of the wallet responsible for deploying contracts (optional)
? Package manager npm

Setting up template in /Users/sf/scratch/playground/example-project...
âœ” Cloned template
âœ” Environment variables set up
â ™ Installing dependencies with npm... This may take a couple minutes.
```

Upon a successful install, the CLI will return a success message with instructions on how to navigate to your project along common commands to use.

```sh
âœ” Dependencies installed

ðŸŽ‰ All set up! ðŸŽ‰

--------------------------

Navigate to your project: cd example-project

Directory Overview:
  - Contracts: /contracts
  - Deployment Scripts: /deploy

Commands:
  - Compile your contracts: npm run compile
  - Deploy your contract: npm run deploy
    - Tip: You can use the --network option to specify the network to deploy to.

Further Reading:
  - Check out the README file in the project location for more details: example-project/README.md

--------------------------
```

Navigate into your project with the command provided from the CLI.

```sh
cd example-project
```

If you are using VSCode for development, you can use the VSCode CLI to launch from the command line.
Depending on your environment, you may need to pre-install some requirements before you can run the VSCode CLI.
For more information, see the section
[Launching from command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line#_launching-from-command-line)
from Visual Studio Code's Command Line Interface (CLI).

```sh
code .
```
