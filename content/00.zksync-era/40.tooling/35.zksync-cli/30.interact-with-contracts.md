description: Interact with smart contracts using ZKsync CLI
---

You can interact with smart contracts on ZKsync using the ZKsync CLI.
These commands automate tasks such as method verification, ABI handling, output decoding and proxy contract processing.

## Read example

Run the following command without any options:

```sh
zksync-cli contract read
```

ZKsync CLI prompts with an interactive list of questions to define the options.

```sh
? Chain to use: ZKsync Sepolia Testnet
? Contract address: 0x927488F48ffbc32112F1fF721759649A89721F8F
```

Next, ZKsync CLI will prompt to select the contract method to call.
If the smart contract is verified on ZKsync, the CLI returns a list of the smart contract's available methods.

```sh
? Contract method to call (Use arrow keys)
  ──────────────── Provided contract ────────────────
❯ allowance(address owner, address spender) view returns (uint256)
  balanceOf(address account) view returns (uint256)
  decimals() view returns (uint8)
  name() view returns (string)
  symbol() view returns (string)
  totalSupply() view returns (uint256)
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Type method manually
```

Otherwise the CLI will prompt you to enter the method signature manually.

```sh
? Enter method to call balanceOf(address account)
```

You can pass the ABI file of the smart contract using the `--abi` option.
This decodes the contract methods and infer the output type of the selected method.

Once you select a method to call, the CLI prompts you to enter the method arguments, one by one:

```sh
? Provide method arguments:
? [1/1] account (address) 0xfAa77e3314c82cD5097B80Ab42C6A3749f33dEE6
```

If you selected a verified method from the list of the smart contract's methods,
you will see a response in it's original encoded form along with the decoded method response.

```sh
✔ Method response (raw): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
✔ Decoded method response: 0
```

If you entered the smart contract's method manually, the CLI will prompt you for the method's **output type** to decode the response.
You can skip this step by submitting an empty response.

```sh
✔ Method response (raw): 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Provide output types to decode the response (optional)
? Output types uint256
✔ Decoded method response: 0
```

To skip the decode method response step, you can use the `--decode-skip` option.

**TIP:** After running a command without options, you will see a full command with all the options defined that you can
copy and use later to quickly run the same command again.

For example, the constructed command for the above:

```sh
npx zksync-cli contract read --chain "zksync-sepolia" --contract "0x927488F48ffbc32112F1fF721759649A89721F8F" --method "balanceOf(address account)" --args "0xfAa77e3314c82cD5097B80Ab42C6A3749f33dEE6" --output "uint256"
```

## Write example

Run the following command without any options:

```sh
zksync-cli contract write
```

ZKsync CLI prompts with an interactive list of questions to define the options.

```sh
? Chain to use: ZKsync Sepolia Testnet
? Contract address: 0x927488F48ffbc32112F1fF721759649A89721F8F
```

Next, ZKsync CLI prompts to select the contract method to call.
If the smart contract is verified on ZKsync, the CLI returns a list of the smart contract's available methods.

```sh
? Contract method to call
  ──────────────── Provided contract ────────────────
  approve(address spender, uint256 amount)
  burn(uint256 amount)
  burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount)
  decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue)
  increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue)
  mint(address _to, uint256 _amount)
❯ transfer(address to, uint256 amount)
  transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
  ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Type method manually
```

Otherwise the CLI will prompt you to enter the method signature manually.

```sh
? Enter method to call transfer(address, uint256)
```

You can pass the ABI file of the smart contract using the `--abi` option.
This will decode the contract methods and infer the output type of the selected method.

Once you select a method to call, the CLI prompts you to enter the method arguments, one by one:

```sh
? Provide method arguments:
? [1/2] to (address) 0xfAa77e3314c82cD5097B80Ab42C6A3749f33dEE6
? [2/2] amount (uint256) 1
```

Next, the CLI prompts for the private key of your wallet to sign the transaction.

```sh
? Private key of the wallet to sign transaction ******
```

When submitted a contract call is be made and a transaction hash will be returned.

```sh
✔ Transaction submitted. Transaction hash: 0x7f82dbf93281930ee01644d01a84b3f13df51d0082370298d353982f008f09e1
✔ Transaction processed successfully. Transaction link: https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/tx/0x7f82dbf93281930ee01644d01a84b3f13df51d0082370298d353982f008f09e1
```

The fully constructed command for the above actions:

```sh
npx zksync-cli contract write --chain "zksync-sepolia" --contract "0x927488F48ffbc32112F1fF721759649A89721F8F" --method "transfer(address to, uint256 amount)" --args "0xfAa77e3314c82cD5097B80Ab42C6A3749f33dEE6" "1"
```

## Encode example

You can encode the contract method signature and arguments into raw calldata.
This can be helpful for debugging or unit testing with lower-level libraries.

To encode a method with arguments, run the CLI command `zksync-cli contract encode`.
The CLI then prompts for the method to encode.

```sh
? Enter method to encode transfer(address, uint256)
```

Next, the CLI will ask for the arguments to provide for the method.

```sh
? Provide method arguments:
? [1/2] address 0xfAa77e3314c82cD5097B80Ab42C6A3749f33dEE6
? [2/2] uint256 1
```

The ZKsync CLI then returns the encoded data for the method with the arguments.

```sh
✔ Encoded data: 0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000faa77e3314c82cd5097b80ab42c6a3749f33dee60000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

## --abi

If you are interacting with a smart contract that is not verified publicly, you can specify a local ABI file with the `--abi` option.
Your ABI data must be in a JSON format or a contract artifact from compilation.

```sh
zksync-cli contract read --abi "./Greeter.json"
```

Providing an ABI for a smart contract will allow the CLI to provide the decoded list of methods to interact with as well as decode the response.

## --from

You can specify another address to execute the transaction with the `--from` option.
This is useful when you need to call a method that expects a specific address as `msg.sender`.

```sh
zksync-cli contract read --from "0xa1cf087DB965Ab02Fb3CFaCe1f5c63935815f044"
```

## --value

To send ETH along with your method call using ZKsync CLI, you can pass a string value with the `--value` option.

```sh
zksync-cli contract write --value "0.1"
```
