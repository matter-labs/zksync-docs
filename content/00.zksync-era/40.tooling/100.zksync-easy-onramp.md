Easy On-Ramp is a free, fully-hosted service that lets anyone purchase ETH or any ERC-20 on ZKsync Era
with a credit card, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or bank transfer — no SDK integration or bridges required.
It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for users to buy tokens without the need for complex setups or technical knowledge.
ZKsync Easy On-Ramp integrates with various fiat on-ramp services along with LI.FI
to provide a seamless experience of buying tokens and swapping them to the desired token.

**Current Flow:**

Fiat → ETH (Transak) → Any Token (LI.FI swap) → User's Era wallet

**Coming Soon:**

Fiat → ETH → Any Token → Auto-transfer to user's address on any Elastic-Network chain

You can experience the ZKsync Easy On-Ramp by visiting the [On-Ramp page on Portal](https://portal.zksync.io/on-ramp).

## Lightweight integration options

Developers can integrate the ZKsync Easy On-Ramp by linking directly to the On-Ramp page on Portal.
Query params can be used to pre-fill the amount, fiat, and token fields along with a redirect URL. The following query params are supported:

- `amount`: The amount in fiat currency to purchase.
- `fiat`: The fiat currency to use for the purchase. Supported currencies are: `USD`.
- `token`: The address of token on ZKsync to purchase. If not provided, the default token is `ETH`.
- `redirect`: The URL to redirect to after the purchase is complete.
    This can be used to redirect users back to your app after the purchase is complete.

Example URL:

```text
https://portal.zksync.io/on-ramp?amount=100&token=0x3A287a06c66f9E95a56327185cA2BDF5f031cEcD&redirect=https://example.com
```

## How it works

Transak processes the fiat payment and delivers ETH to a non-custodial contract on ZKsync Era.
LI.FI swaps ETH to the requested ERC-20 (if needed) at the best available on-chain rate.
Tokens arrive in the user's Era wallet in one seamless transaction.

All KYC/AML checks are handled by the payment provider; Easy On-Ramp never stores user PII.
