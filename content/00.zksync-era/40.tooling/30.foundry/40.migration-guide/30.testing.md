### Bytecode Constraints

#### Issue

On ZKsync, bytecode must conform to specific size and length constraints to be
considered valid. These constraints ensure that the bytecode operates correctly within
ZKsync's modified zkEVM environment. Bytecode that does not meet these criteria will result in compilation or deployment errors.

The bytecode constraints are as follows:

- The bytecode length (in bytes) must be divisible by 32 (32-byte words).
- The bytecode must have fewer than 2^16 words.
- The bytecode length (in words) must be an odd number.

#### Problematic Code

Consider a test scenario where we attempt to manually set the bytecode at a specific
address using Foundry’s `vm.etch` cheatcode. In this example, some attempts to etch the bytecode violate the size and word alignment rules.

```solidity
contract FooTest is Test {
    function testFoo() public {
        // Invalid, word-size of 1 byte
        vm.etch(address(65536), hex"00");

        // Invalid, even number of words
        vm.etch(
            address(65536),
            hex"00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        );

        // Valid, 32-byte word, odd number of words
        vm.etch(
            address(65536),
            hex"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        );
    }
}
```

In this code:

- The first `vm.etch` call uses a 1-byte word, which is invalid because ZKsync requires the bytecode length to be divisible by 32 bytes.
- The second `vm.etch` call uses a bytecode of 64 bytes (even number of words), which is also invalid because ZKsync requires an odd number of words.
- The third `vm.etch` call uses a valid bytecode length of 32 bytes (1 word), which is both divisible by 32 bytes and contains an odd number of words.

#### Error

The first two cases will produce errors due to violating the bytecode size and word constraints:

```bash
Error: Invalid bytecode length: not divisible by 32
Error: Invalid bytecode: length of even number of words
```

These errors indicate that the bytecode fails to meet ZKsync’s requirements for bytecode validity.

#### Solution

To resolve these errors, ensure that the bytecode conforms to the following rules:

- The length of the bytecode must always be divisible by 32 bytes.
- The total word count (in 32-byte words) must be an odd number.
- The bytecode should be less than 2^16 words in length.

#### Fixed Code Example

Here’s how to correctly etch the bytecode in ZKsync, following the bytecode constraints:

```solidity
contract FooTest is Test {
    function testFoo() public {
        // Valid, 32-byte word, odd number of words
        vm.etch(
            address(65536),
            hex"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        );
    }
}
```

In this fixed example:

- The bytecode length is exactly 32 bytes (one 32-byte word), which satisfies ZKsync's requirement for bytecode size divisibility by 32.
- The total word count is odd (1 word), meeting the requirement for an odd number of words.

### Cheatcode Limitations

#### Issue

In ZKsync's zkEVM, cheatcodes are only supported at the root level of an executing test,
meaning they must be called outside of any `CREATE` or `CALL` operations that are
dispatched to the zkEVM. Cheatcodes used within contract constructors or function calls
that dispatch transactions will not work and can lead to undefined behavior.

#### Valid Cheatcode Usage

Cheatcodes can be used normally in tests as long as they are outside of any contract
creation (`CREATE`) or external function calls (`CALL`). Here's an example demonstrating valid cheatcode usage:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    function getNumber() public returns (uint256) {
        return 42;
    }
}

contract FooTest is Test {
    function testFoo_1() public {
        vm.roll(10);                    // valid
        vm.assertEq(10, block.number);   // valid cheatcode usage
    }

    function testFoo_2() public {
        vm.roll(10);                    // valid
        new MyContract();                // valid because vm.roll is called outside of contract creation
    }

    function testFoo_3() public {
        vm.roll(10);                    // valid
        MyContract testContract = new MyContract();
        testContract.getNumber();        // valid as cheatcodes are used before the contract interaction
    }
}
```

In these cases, the `vm.roll` cheatcode is valid because it is called outside of any contract creation or function calls that interact with zkEVM.

#### Cheatcode Usage in Libraries

Since libraries do not result in a `CREATE` or `CALL`, you can use cheatcodes within
library functions without issues. Here's an example of how libraries can use cheatcodes:

```solidity
library MyLibrary {
    function setBlockNumber(uint256 value) public {
        vm.roll(value);                 // valid cheatcode usage in a library
    }
}

contract FooTest is Test {
    function testFoo_1() public {
        vm.roll(10);                    // valid
        vm.assertEq(10, block.number);
        MyLibrary.setBlockNumber(20);    // valid cheatcode usage within a library
        vm.assertEq(10, block.number);   // valid
    }
}
```

Libraries can call cheatcodes since they do not trigger a contract creation or external call, making them valid for cheatcode usage in ZKsync.

#### Problematic Code

Cheatcodes used within contract constructors or functions that dispatch transactions to
the zkEVM will result in undefined behavior or fail to execute. Here's an example demonstrating invalid cheatcode usage:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    constructor() {
        vm.roll(20);                    // invalid cheatcode usage inside a constructor
    }

    function getNumber() public returns (uint256) {
        vm.roll(20);                    // invalid cheatcode usage inside a function
        return 42;
    }
}

contract FooTest is Test {
    function testFoo_1() public {
        vm.roll(10);                    // valid
        MyContract testContract = new MyContract();  // invalid due to vm.roll in constructor
        testContract.getNumber();        // invalid due to vm.roll in function
    }
}
```

In this example, `vm.roll` is used inside the constructor and a function of
`MyContract`, which will not work on ZKsync because the cheatcode is executed within a `CREATE` or `CALL` operation.

#### Error

Although the error messages may not be explicit, calling cheatcodes inside a contract's
constructor or function will either lead to undefined behavior or failure during the test execution.

#### Solution

To ensure cheatcodes work as expected on ZKsync, always call them outside of contract
constructors or external function calls. Use libraries or test-level cheatcodes for reliable test execution.

#### Fixed Code Example

Here’s an example of valid cheatcode usage in a test:

```solidity
contract MyContract {
    function getNumber() public returns (uint256) {
        return 42;
    }
}

contract FooTest is Test {
    function testFoo() public {
        vm.roll(10);                    // valid cheatcode usage
        MyContract testContract = new MyContract();  // no cheatcodes inside contract
        testContract.getNumber();        // no cheatcodes inside function
    }
}
```

This example ensures that the cheatcodes are called only at the test level, outside any contract creation or external function calls.

### Forking

When using forking cheatcodes such as `vm.selectFork` or `vm.createSelectFork` in tests,
the execution context automatically switches based on the network being forked.

- **Forking to a ZKsync Network**: If the RPC endpoint supports ZKsync (verified by
checking the presence of the `zks_L1ChainId` method), the test execution switches to the
ZKsync context. This means the test will follow ZKsync-specific behaviors and limitations.

- **Forking to a non-ZKsync network**: If the selected fork is not a ZKsync endpoint, the test execution remains in the standard EVM context.

### Cheatcode Override

To manually control the execution context, a custom cheatcode `vm.zkVm` is provided:

- **Enabling ZKsync mode**: Use `vm.zkVm(true)` to switch the test execution to ZKsync mode.
- **Switching back to EVM mode**: Use `vm.zkVm(false)` to revert back to the standard EVM mode during test execution.

#### Note

Using the `--zksync` flag when running tests is equivalent to placing `vm.zkVm(true)` as
the first statement in the test, automatically setting the execution to ZKsync mode.

### Origin Address

#### Issue

In ZKSync's zkEVM, calls to `tx.origin` are not supported, unlike in Ethereum
where `tx.origin` can be used to retrieve the original external account that initiated
the transaction. As a result, any attempts to mock or interact with `tx.origin` in ZKSync will fail.

#### Problematic Code

In the following example, the `tx.origin` address is used in a mocked call. While this
works in Ethereum, it will not work in ZKsync because `tx.origin` is unsupported.

```solidity
library IFooBar {
    function number() external view returns (uint8);
}

contract FooTest is Test {
    function testFoo() public {
        address target = tx.origin; // Invalid on ZKsync

        vm.mockCall(
            address(target),
            abi.encodeWithSelector(bytes4(keccak256("number()"))),
            abi.encode(5)
        );

        IFooBar(target).number(); // This call will fail on ZKsync
    }
}
```

In this code, `tx.origin` is used to obtain the address of the original transaction sender, but on ZKsync, any interaction involving `tx.origin` will fail.

#### Error

Attempting to use `tx.origin` on ZKsync will result in failed transactions or mocked
calls. However, ZKSync may not provide specific error messages related to the failure, making it difficult to trace the root cause.

#### Solution

You should use `msg.sender` instead of using `tx.origin` to track the address of the current external caller, which is supported on ZKsync.

#### Fixed Code Example

```solidity
library IFooBar {
    function number() external view returns (uint8);
}

contract FooTest is Test {
    function testFoo() public {
        address target = msg.sender; // Valid on ZKsync

        vm.mockCall(
            address(target),
            abi.encodeWithSelector(bytes4(keccak256("number()"))),
            abi.encode(5)
        );

        IFooBar(target).number(); // This will now work on ZKsync
    }
}
```

In this fixed example, `msg.sender` is used instead of `tx.origin`, which ensures compatibility with ZKsync.

### Reserved Address Range

#### Issue

On ZKsync's zkEVM, addresses in the range `[0..2^16-1]` are reserved for kernel space,
meaning they are not available for contract deployment or other user-level interactions.
Attempting to use these addresses, either directly or through mocking, can lead to undefined behavior in your tests.

#### Problematic Code

In this test example, the address `0` is used in a mocked call. Since this address is
part of the reserved range, using it will result in undefined behavior and test failures.

```solidity
contract FooTest is Test {
    function testFoo() public {
        // Invalid: Using an address within the reserved range
        vm.mockCall(
            address(0),
            abi.encodeWithSelector(bytes4(keccak256("number()"))),
            abi.encode(5)
        );
    }
}
```

This example attempts to mock a call to `address(0)`, which is part of the reserved kernel space and therefore invalid on ZKsync.

#### Error

Using addresses within the reserved range may lead to undefined behavior and possible
test failures without specific error messages. It's crucial to avoid these addresses entirely to ensure test reliability.

#### Solution

Ensure that addresses used for testing and mocking are outside of the reserved kernel
space range. Start from address `65536` onwards for any user-level interaction.

In fuzz testing, you can exclude the reserved address range either by setting assumptions or using specific fuzz configuration.

Here’s a corrected test example:

#### Fixed Code Example

```solidity
contract FooTest is Test {
    function testFoo() public {
        // Valid: Using an address outside of the reserved range
        vm.mockCall(
            address(65536),
            abi.encodeWithSelector(bytes4(keccak256("number()"))),
            abi.encode(5)
        );
    }
}
```

In this corrected example, we use `address(65536)`, which is a valid user-space address in ZKsync.

#### Additional Configuration

During fuzz testing, it's important to avoid generating addresses within the reserved range. This can be done in two ways:

1. **Using `vm.assume`**:
   You can assert that the address generated in fuzz testing is greater than or equal to `65536`:

   ```solidity
   vm.assume(address(value) >= 65536);
   ```

2. **Fuzz Configuration**:
   Alternatively, you can set the `no_zksync_reserved_addresses` option in your fuzz configuration to automatically exclude addresses in the reserved range.

   ```toml
   [profile.default]
   fuzz = { no_zksync_reserved_addresses = true }
   ```

These approaches ensure that fuzz testing
avoids the reserved kernel space,
preventing test failures and ensuring compliance with ZKsync's address rules.
