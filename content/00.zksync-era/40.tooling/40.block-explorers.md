### Block Explorer API

Weâ€™ve developed the ZKsync Era Block Explorer API for developers to access ZKsync Era Block Explorer data directly via HTTP requests.

The API provides various endpoints for many use cases you might want in your app. It is compatible with [Etherscan APIs](https://docs.etherscan.io/),
which makes it easy to transition your existing apps to ZKsync Era network.
