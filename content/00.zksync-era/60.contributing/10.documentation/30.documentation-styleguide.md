title: Documentation Styleguide
description: A comprehensive guide on ZKsync documentation standards, including writing style, Markdown conventions, code snippets, and documentation categorization.
---

This guide outlines the standards for creating ZKsync documentation,
ensuring consistency in writing style, Markdown conventions, and code snippets.

## Writing Style

For readability across a diverse audience, including non-native English speakers, we adhere to industry best practices from:

- [Google Developer Documentation Styleguide](https://developers.google.com/style)
- [Microsoft Writing Styleguide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)

It's crucial to create content that is inclusive, diverse, and timeless. Focus on:

- [Inclusive documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation)
- [Timeless documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/timeless-documentation)
- [Bias-free communication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/bias-free-communication)
- [Global communications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/global-communications/)

## Spelling

Content in ZKsync Docs are run through a linter for markdown formatting and spellchecking.
Some words may not pass the spellcheck linter and will need to be added to the dictionary list.
New words can be added to lists in `/cspell-config`. All words added to the dictionary are checked
for spelling only.

## Time & Dates

To minimize confusion due to global date format variations, adhere to the following in ZKsync docs:

- Start calendars on Mondays.
- Use the date format `month dd, yyyy`, avoiding numerals for months (e.g., January 5, 2018).

## Types of documentation

Following the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework, ZKsync Docs categorizes content into

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step instructions to teach general skills (e.g., Deploying your first contract on ZKsync Era).
- **Guides**: Task completion instructions for readers with basic knowledge (e.g., Debugging with zksync-cli).
- **References**: Detailed technical descriptions (e.g., Ethereum JSON-RPC API).
- **Explanation**: Content to deepen subject understanding
(e.g., Differences between ZKsync Native Account Abstraction and Ethereum's EIP 4337).

### Choosing a category

Leverage the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) system when crafting a new article for ZKsync Docs.
Writing without a clear category often results in unfocused content.
A well-defined focus keeps the content streamlined and clarifies the takeaway for the reader.

While adhering to this system, it may become evident that a single article
cannot encompass all aspects you wish to convey.
Feel encouraged to create multiple articles across different categories to comprehensively address your topic.

## Add new documentation

To add new pages to our documentation, create new files under the `/content` directory.

### Naming scheme

File and folder names are prefixed with a number that Nuxt uses to handle what order pages are displayed in navigation.
We use a two-digit numbering system to allow for easier re-ordering of files.

If you are creating a new directory, **name your first file `00.index.md`**.
This ensures there is a root path to the page.
The display name will be defined by the title in the frontmatter.

### _dir.yml

The `_dir.yml` allows for further configuration of the directory.
The `title` defined in this file is what defines the header for the dropdown panel in navigation.

### Frontmatter

All pages must have frontmatter with a `title` and `description`.
If you do not want a description for your page, simply leave the `description` value blank.

## Images

Add images to the `public/images/` directory to use in ZKsync docs
and reference them from the `/images` path, do not include the `public/`.
Use the markdown format to display images.

```md
![Image Alt Text](/images/example-image.png)
```

- Keep your image size to 600-960px wide.
- If you are displaying visual diagrams with text, use svg format for best clarity.
- Avoid using images to display only text, code or data output, use actual text.
- Every image should have a descriptive alt text.
- Optimize your image using a service like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

## Icons

Utilize Nuxt UI icons with the [`UIcon` component](https://ui.nuxt.com/components/icon), following the naming pattern `i-{collection_name}-{icon_name}`.
The icon collections pre-configured for this project are `heroicons`, `simple-icons`, `devicon` and `logos`.

You can browse the icons available in each collection on [Icones](https://icones.js.org/). This browser is also available from the Nuxt Debug tools.

```md
:u-icon{name="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
```

## Links

Internal links are generated in relation to the `/content` directory and the name of the markdown file.

For example, the file `/content/1.quick-start/2.deploy-contract.md` is defined as the path `/quick-start/deploy-contract`.
**Do not** add the number or file extension on the link.

Example link to an internal page using markdown format, with an anchor tag.

```md
[Getting Started](/build/start-coding/zksync-101#install-docker)
```

## Markdown and Vue components

ZKsync Docs combine Markdown with Vue components though the syntax is different.
For example, if you use a [Nuxt UI Button component](https://ui.nuxt.com/components/button), the html syntax would be the following:

```html
<UButton color="primary" variant="solid">
  I am a button
</UButton>
```

In markdown, the syntax changes to the following:

```md
::u-button{ color="primary" variant="solid" }
  I am a button
::
```

If the Vue component is an inline slot-less component, you can use a simplified inline format.

```html
<UButton label="Button" />
<!-- format in markdown -->
:u-button{ label="button" }
```

Learn more about using Markdown and Vue components with Nuxt Content's page on [Markdown](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/markdown).

### Content Switcher

For content organization into tabs, utilize the `ContentSwitcher` component.
Apply the `items` prop to distribute content across tabs.
Organize these partials in a folder that matches the parent markdown file’s name,
preceded by an underscore.

Use the Content Switcher component in a situation where you have more than one
option to display for a subject depending on the reader's choices. For example,
use the Content Switcher component for a tutorial that provides a Remix and
Atlas option.

```md
::content-switcher
---
items: [{
  label: 'HardHat',
  partial: '_getting-started/_aPartial'
}, {
  label: 'Forge',
  partial: '_getting-started/_anotherpartial'
}]
---
::
```

### Callouts

Callouts present warnings, extra detail, or references to related topics.
A callout should not contain anything essential to understanding the main content.

#### Example
::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
This is a `callout` with full **markdown** support. It can have markdown content like a link to [another page](/build/start-coding/zksync-101).
::

#### Code

```md
::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
This is a `callout` with full **markdown** support. It can have markdown content like a link to [another page](/build/start-coding/zksync-101).
::
```

## Code Samples

Use code samples where it helps to explain technical concepts. Create concise examples that are easy to read and understand,
avoid pasting an entire file of code.
Always define the language the code is represented in next to the backticks.
Additionally, you can define the name of the file to display as a header on the block.

#### Example

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: ['@nuxt/ui-pro'],
  modules: ['@nuxt/ui']
})
```

#### Code

```ts
    ```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      extends: ['@nuxt/ui-pro'],
      modules: ['@nuxt/ui']
    })
    ```
```

## Localization

Currently, ZKsync Docs does not offer localized documentation.
Updates to this section will be provided as localization features become available.

## Use of AI

While fully AI-generated content is not accepted for ZKsync Docs,
the assistance of AI tools like ChatGPT in editing content is permitted.
These tools can enhance the editing process,
although they may occasionally produce inaccurate information.
Always carefully review any AI-assisted content before finalizing.

You can use the following as a prompt for an AI tool to help with editing:

```text
The content is written in common markdown format.
Use the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide and the Microsoft Style Guide, emphasizing Bias-free communication.
Write in an active voice.
Do not use the definite or indefinite article with “ZKsync Era”.
Assume the reader may be an international person whose first language might not be English.
Don’t use overly complex words unless the technical description is lost if changed.
Ensure all communication is bias-free, following the Microsoft Style Guide's directives for inclusiveness and fairness in language.
If the article I submit has a Header1 at the beginning, move that into a yaml frontmatter for the 'title' property.
Include a short description of the article in the yaml frontmatter in the 'description' property.
```

If your content includes technical descriptions and code examples, you can add the following to your prompt
to assist with formatting.

```text
Always use the word “function” and never the word “method” when referring to Solidity code.
Always use the word “function” for functions in JavaScript and TypeScript.
Always use the word “method” for attributes of an object in JavaScript and TypeScript.
When talking about Rust, always use the word “function” for functions defined on a type, and the word “method” for functions defined on an instance of a type.
When referring to a JSON RPC URL method, always use the word “method”.
```
