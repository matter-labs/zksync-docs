This section outlines user authentication and session management the flows within an application using ZKsync SSO.

## Create new Smart Sign-On
![zksync sso transaction flow](/images/zksync-sso/zksync-sso-create-passkey.png)

#### 1. User Initiates Sign-In
The user navigates to an app and clicks "Connect" button.

#### 2. Passkey Creation
User is prompted to create a new passkey (e.g., Face ID, Fingerprint).
User uses biometrics or PIN to create a passkey. Private key for this passkey is stored on the physical device.

#### 3. Passkey Public data is sent to Auth Server
Passkey Public Key and Credential ID is sent to Auth Server. Credential ID is a globally unique value that identifies a specific passkey.
We use it to tie user passkey to their address on chain.

#### 4. Passkeys are recorded on chain
A new smart contract account is deployed by ZKsync SSO Auth Server using `deployAccount(public-key, credential-id)`.
Passkey public data is deployed on ZKsync Era chain for a user's new `0x` account address.

#### 5. Return account address to Auth Server

A smart contract returns a new `0x` account address on ZKsync Era back to the Auth Server, for which the user's passkey will serve as a signer.

#### 6. Account address is shared with App

Auth Server returns the new `0x` account address back to the application

## Create SSO Session
![zksync sso transaction flow](/images/zksync-sso/zksync-sso-create-session.png)

#### 1. App requests a new session

Application creates a transaction to request a new session using SSO SDK.
Application needs to create `Session Public Key`, `Session Private Key`, `Session Config`.

#### 2. Session request is sent to Auth Server
Application calls `createSession(SessionPublicKey, SessionConfig)` on Auth Server.

#### 3. Transaction approval

Auth Server  validates the session, displays it to the user and requests a Passkey from user's local device to sign the session creation transaction.
User uses a passkey either by entering a PIN or scanning their biometics to authorize the transaction.

#### 4. Auth Server creates a session

Auth Server calls `createSession(SessionPublicKey, SessionConfig)` on the smart account, which in turn adds a session entry on chain.

#### 5. Smart contract returns tx receipt

Upon successful session creation on chain, a smart account returns transaction confirmation back to the Auth Server.
Auth Server stores the session information in their local storage.

#### 6. Session confirmation sent to the app

Auth Server sends transaction confirmation of session creation back to the application.
From here on, application is authorized to sign transactions on user's behalf using `Session Private Key` created in step 1.
`Session Private Key` is valid as long as session is not expired and transactions are within approved policies defined in `Session Config`.
