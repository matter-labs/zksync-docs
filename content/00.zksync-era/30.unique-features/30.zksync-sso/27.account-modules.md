description: Get familiar with ZKsync SSO smart account modules.
---

Developers can enhance the functionality of ZKsync SSO accounts by implementing compatible modules via smart contracts.
The module interface is based on [ERC-7579](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579#modules)
to allow maximum flexibility while using ZKsync's powerful native account abstraction to developer overhead.

The existing passkey and session features are already implemented as modules,
and installed by default for every new account deployment.
Modules can be added or removed from the account, without having to migrate or upgrade the whole account.

## Contributing Modules

You can contribute to the smart account modules available to ZKsync SSO users by
submitting a PR to the [`zksync-sso-clave-contracts`](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-sso-clave-contracts) repository.

Modules must implement the
[`IModuleValidator`](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-sso-clave-contracts/tree/main/src/interfaces/IModuleValidator.sol) interface.
The current implemented modules can be found in the [`validators` folder](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-sso-clave-contracts/tree/main/src/validators).
