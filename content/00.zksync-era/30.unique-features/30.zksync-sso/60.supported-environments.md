ZKsync SSO currently supports web applications through its JavaScript SDK, allowing seamless integration with modern browsers.

**Supported Browsers:**

- **Google Chrome**
- **Safari**
- **Mozilla Firefox**
- **Microsoft Edge**
- **Opera**

See the full list of specific versions [here](https://caniuse.com/webauthn).

This broad browser support ensures a smooth user experience across various platforms.

## Coming Soon

Windows 10 users with [Windows Hello](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/tips/windows-hello) will
not be able to use PIN or facial recognition until RS256 support is added in a future module.
Until then, using a mobile device or a password manager will be required to create compatable passkeys on Windows 10.
The user may still see these options, but will be unable to create an account with the passkey on this platform.

### Native Mobile Integrations

iOS and Android mobile SDKs are *coming soon* and will enable developers to incorporate ZKsync SSO features into native mobile applications.
