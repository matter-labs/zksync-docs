In case you lose your passkeys, ZKsync SSO will provide several methods to recover your account.

## Multiple Devices with Passkey Synchronization

Users can synchronize their passkeys across multiple devices using services like iCloud Keychain for Apple devices or similar services on other platforms.
This means if one device is lost, the passkeys are still accessible on other synchronized devices.

## Other Options

*More account recovery options are coming soon.*

<!--
**Adding another auth page — *coming soon**?*
To avoid the reliance on a single trusted domain,
users can create or connect to a ZKsync SSO auth page hosted on a different domain!
By providing their account address, the alternate page can provide a great back-up location for passkeys.
These passkeys could be stored via FIDO device or a different online passkey provider than the primary key.

**Adding another passkey — *coming soon***

Users can register a new device by adding a new passkey to their account.
This typically involves verifying their identity on the new device, after which the new passkey is securely associated with their account.

**Recovery via Externally Owned Account (EOA) — *coming soon***

Users will soon be able to link an EOA to their ZKsync SSO.
If passkeys are lost, they can recover access by authenticating with their EOA, providing an additional layer of security and recovery option.

**Recovery via OAuth 2.0 — *coming soon***

OAuth Recovery ERC-7579 module enables users to set up an account recovery through OAuth tokens associated with their existing Web2 logins like
Gmail, Facebook, or X (formerly Twitter). This allows users to regain access by logging in with their familiar social media or email accounts.
