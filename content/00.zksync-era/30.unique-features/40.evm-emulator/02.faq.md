title: Emulator FAQ
description: The following questions are related to usage of the EVM Bytecode Emulator.
---

#### Can I use default Foundry instead of Foundry-zksync?
Yes. Although as gas logic on EraVM differs from the EVM, it's recommended to use the `--skip-simulation` flag.

#### Can I use Hardhat without the `hardhat-zksync` plugin?
Yes, Hardhat works without ZKsync-specific plugins.

#### What is the EVM version used by the EVM Emulator?
The EVM emulator targets **Cancun**.

#### Given that on EraVM contract deployment is done via the `ContractDeployer`, how does deployment work using the EVM Emulator?
You can deploy contracts just like on Ethereum (e.g., a transaction to `0x0` with the contract bytecode) and use tools like Hardhat
and Foundry out of the box (no plugins needed).

#### How does the emulator contract get invoked on execution?
Invoking the EVM emulator is handled behind the scenes by the protocol. Developers donâ€™t need to take any extra steps.
If you want to learn more, check the protocol documentation.

#### Are EVM-bytecode contracts and EraVM-bytecode contracts allowed to interact with each other transparently?
Contracts deployed with EVM bytecode can interact with contracts deployed with EraVM bytecode, **except for delegate calls**,
which are prohibited between EraVM and EVM bytecode contracts.

Find more details in [EraVM-EVM interactions](../../../zksync-protocol/contracts/evm-emulator/era-evm-interactions.md).

#### Will address derivation with regular `create` and `create2` be the same as on other EVM chains?
Yes.

#### Is the EVM emulator 100% compatible with EVM?
No. Although emulation covers most developers' needs, there are limitations due to the underlying EraVM, such as unsupported opcodes or gas differences.
Full EVM equivalence is expected with the next proving system in **2025**.

See [Limitations page in the protocol documentation](../../../zksync-protocol/contracts/evm-emulator/limitations).

#### What's the behavior of `block.gaslimit`? Does it return the batch limit or the transaction limit?
It returns `1125899906842624n`, the batch limit.
This differs from the value returned by EVM chains: `36000000n`.
