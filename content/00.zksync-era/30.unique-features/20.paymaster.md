description: Learn about support for Paymasters in ZKsync Era
---

Besides Account Abstraction, ZKsync Era natively supports paymasters. Introduced in [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#extension-paymasters),
paymasters allow to implement an intermediate step for transaction processing that can alter how the fees are being processed.

This feature can be used for things like:

- Ability to pay fees in ERC20 or even NFT tokens.
- Subsidizing transactions.
- Managing fee payments for a static set of wallets.

...and many others.

If you want to learn about Paymaster design, see the [protocol documentation](/zksync-protocol/account-abstraction/paymasters).

## Testnet Paymaster

To simplify development and testing, %%zk_testnet_name%% provides a **testnet paymaster** with built-in support for paying fees in ERC20 tokens.

**Key details:**

- **Address**: `0x3cb2b87d10ac01736a65688f3e0fb1b070b3eea3` ([see in explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/address/0x3cb2b87d10ac01736a65688f3e0fb1b070b3eea3))
- **Chain**: %%zk_testnet_name%%
- **Exchange rate**: 1:1 with ETH (1 token unit = 1 wei)
- **Flow type**: Approval-based only
- **Usage requirements**:
  - `token`: must match the ERC20 token used for fee payment
  - `minimalAllowance`: must be at least `tx.maxFeePerGas * tx.gasLimit`
  - `innerInput`: must be empty (`0x`)

**Example usage:**

```ts
const paymasterParams = {
  paymaster: "0x3cb2b87d10ac01736a65688f3e0fb1b070b3eea3",
  paymasterInput: {
    type: "ApprovalBased",
    token: "<ERC20_TOKEN_ADDRESS>",
    minimalAllowance: tx.maxFeePerGas * tx.gasLimit, // at least
    innerInput: "0x",
  },
};
```

This setup allows developers to simulate ERC20-based fee payments in a testnet environment without needing a custom paymaster deployment.
