---

Besides Account Abstraction, ZKsync natively supports paymasters. Introduced in [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337#extension-paymasters),
paymasters allow to implement an intermediate step for transaction processing that can alter how the fees are being processed.

This feature can be used for things like:

- Ability to pay fees in ERC20 or even NFT tokens.
- Subsidizing transactions.
- Managing fee payments for a static set of wallets.

...and many others.

If you want to learn about Paymaster design, see the [protocol documentation](/zksync-protocol/account-abstraction/paymasters).
