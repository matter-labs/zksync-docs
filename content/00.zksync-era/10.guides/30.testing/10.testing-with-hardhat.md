description: Learn how to test on anvil-zksync with Hardhat.

In the world of decentralized applications, the margin for error is remarkably narrow.
A single mistake in a contract can have catastrophic implications.
For those seeking an efficient method to test and refine their contracts,
this guide showcases how to utilize Hardhat and `anvil-zksync` for all testing needs.

To test our contract, we are going to use Hardhat and `anvil-zksync` for rapid local development.
In our tests we're going to use `zksync-ethers` to interact with the `Greeter` contract,
and we'll use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as our test runner.

### Prerequisites

- `zksync-cli` installed from the [zksync-cli section](/build/zksync-cli).
- `anvil-zksync` installed. See [anvil-zksync](/build/test-and-debug/in-memory-node).

---
## Environment setup

1. Create a new project with the required dependencies and boilerplate paymaster implementations:

    ```bash
    zksync-cli create test-greeter --template hardhat_solidity
    ```

    Use the private key below to use a pre-configured rich wallet for deployment and testing:

    ```bash
    ? Private key of the wallet responsible for deploying contracts (optional)
    0x7726827caac94a7f9e1b160f7ea819f172f7b6f9d2a97f992c38edeab82d4110
    ```

    The contract for this guide exists under `/contracts/Greeter.sol`.

1. Install the dependencies:

    ::code-group

    ```bash [npm]
    npm install
    ```

    ```bash [yarn]
    yarn install
    ```

    ```bash [pnpm]
    pnpm install
    ```

    ```bash [bun]
    bun install
    ```

    ::

1. Compile the contracts:

    :display-partial{path="/_partials/commands/_compile"}

## Run tests with Hardhat

Under the `/test` directory there is a `greeter.test.ts` file. The initial test checks if our `Greeter` contract returns the set greeting.

```typescript [/test/greeter.test.ts]
:code-import{filePath="hardhat-sol-template/test/greeter.test.ts"}
```

To run this test:

:display-partial{path="/_partials/commands/_test-greeter"}

You should see the following output:

```sh
  Greeter
    ✔ Should return the new greeting once it's changed (174ms)

  1 passing (174ms)
```

## Expand test coverage

Our aim is comprehensive coverage. Here are the test scenarios we will cover:

1. **Testing greet() function**: Check the returned greeting.
2. **Testing setGreeting() function**: Verify the ability to update greetings.
3. **Testing Insufficient Funds**: Ensure transactions fail without enough funds.

Each of these test cases will rely on a common setup,
which involves creating a provider connected to the %%zk_testnet_name%%, initializing a wallet with a known private key,
and deploying the `Greeter` contract.

Let's refactor our test file with the provided script:

::drop-panel
  ::panel{label="test/greeter.test.ts"}
    ```typescript [greeter.test.ts]
    :code-import{filePath="hardhat-sol-template/test/greeter-expanded.test.ts"}
    ```
  ::
::

To run this test:

:display-partial{path="/_partials/commands/_test-greeter"}

You should see the following output:

```sh
  Greeter
    ✔ Should return the new greeting once it's changed (211ms)
    ✔ Should set a new greeting and return it (2682ms)
    ✔ Should fail when insufficient funds (299ms)

  3 passing (6s)
```

## Understanding the test file

Have a look at the `test/greeter.test.ts` file's imports:

```typescript [test/greeter.test.ts]
:code-import{filePath="hardhat-sol-template/test/greeter-expanded.test.ts:imports"}
```

This section imports all necessary utilities and configurations needed to run our tests.

- `expect` from Chai provides assertion functionalities for our tests.
- `Wallet`, and the `Contract` type from `ethers` help us creating a wallet and defining a contract's type.
- `hre` gives us hardhat specific functionalities for deploying and interacting with our contract.

#### Main Test Suite

```javascript
describe('Greeter', function () {
  ...
});
```

Here, we've declared our main test suite.
Each test or nested suite inside provides specific scenarios or functionalities we want to test regarding the Greeter contract.

1. **Initialization**

    Before running any test, we initialize commonly used variables like the provider, wallet, deployer, and the greeter contract.

2. **Test greet() function**

    We check that the greet function returns the initial greeting of 'Hi' after deployment.

    ```javascript
    it("Should return the new greeting once it's changed", async function () { ... });
    ```

3. **Test setGreeting() function**

    We test that setting a new greeting updates the contract's state as expected.

    ```javascript
    it("Should set a new greeting and return it", async function () { ... });
    ```

4. **Test insufficient funds**

    Here, we simulate a scenario where an empty wallet (with no funds) tries to set a new greeting.
    We make use of the `connect` method on your `zksync-ethers` Contract object to connect it to a different account.

    ```javascript
    it("Should fail when insufficient funds", async function () { ... });
    ```
