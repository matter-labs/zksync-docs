description: Learn how to test on era-test-node with Hardhat.
---

In the world of decentralized applications, the margin for error is remarkably narrow.
A single mistake in a contract can have catastrophic implications.
For those seeking an efficient method to test and refine their contracts,
this guide showcases how to utilize Hardhat and `era_test_node` for all testing needs.

To test our contract, we are going to use Hardhat and `era_test_node` for rapid local development.
In our tests we're going to use `zksync-ethers` to interact with the `Greeter` contract,
and we'll use [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as our test runner.

### Prerequisites

- `zksync-cli` installed from the [zksync-cli section](/build/zksync-cli).
- `era_test_node` installed and running. See [In-memory Node](/build/test-and-debug/in-memory-node).

---
## Environment setup

1. Create a new project with the required dependencies and boilerplate paymaster implementations:

    ```bash
    zksync-cli create test-greeter
    ```

    Choose `Hardhat + Solidity` to setup the project repository. The contract for this guide exists under `/contracts/Greeter.sol`.

    Install dependencies:

    ::code-group

    ```bash [yarn]
    yarn install
    ```

    ```bash [npm]
    npm install
    ```

    ```bash [bun]
    bun install
    ```

    ::

1. Add the following additional dependencies:

    ::code-group

    ```bash [yarn]
    yarn add -D @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
    ```

    ```bash [npm]
    npm add @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers --save-dev
    ```

    ```bash [bun]
    bun add @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers --dev
    ```

    ::

1. Import `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers` into the `hardhat.config.ts` file:

    ```typescript [hardhat.config.ts]
    import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers";
    ```

    The `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers` plugin adds Ethereum specific capabilities
    to the [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) assertion library for testing smart contracts.

1. Start `era_test_node`:

    ```bash
    ./target/release/era_test_node run
    ```

## Run tests with Hardhat

Under the `/test` directory there is a `main.test.ts` . The initial test checks if our `Greeter` contract returns the set greeting.

```typescript [/test/main.test.ts]
import { expect } from "chai";
import { Wallet, Provider, Contract } from "zksync-ethers";
import * as hre from "hardhat";
import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync";
import { zkSyncTestnet } from "../hardhat.config";

const RICH_WALLET_PK = "0x7726827caac94a7f9e1b160f7ea819f172f7b6f9d2a97f992c38edeab82d4110";

async function deployGreeter(deployer: Deployer): Promise<Contract> {
  const artifact = await deployer.loadArtifact("Greeter");
  return await deployer.deploy(artifact, ["Hi"]);
}

describe("Greeter", function () {
  it("Should return the new greeting once it's changed", async function () {
    const provider = new Provider(zkSyncTestnet.url);

    const wallet = new Wallet(RICH_WALLET_PK, provider);
    const deployer = new Deployer(hre, wallet);

    const greeter = await deployGreeter(deployer);

    expect(await greeter.greet()).to.eq("Hi");

    const setGreetingTx = await greeter.setGreeting("Hola, mundo!");
    // wait until the transaction is mined
    await setGreetingTx.wait();

    expect(await greeter.greet()).to.equal("Hola, mundo!");
  });
});
```

To run this test:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn test
```

```bash [npm]
npm test
```

```bash [bun]
bun run test
```

::
You should see the following output:

```sh
  Greeter
    ✔ Should return the new greeting once it's changed (174ms)

  1 passing (174ms)
```

## Expand test coverage

Our aim is comprehensive coverage. Here are the test scenarios we will cover:

1. **Testing greet() function**: Check the returned greeting.
2. **Testing setGreeting() function**: Verify the ability to update greetings.
3. **Testing Insufficient Funds**: Ensure transactions fail without enough funds.
4. **Event Emission**: Ensure an event is emitted when changing the greeting.

Each of these test cases will rely on a common setup,
which involves creating a provider connected to the %%zk_testnet_name%%, initializing a wallet with a known private key,
and deploying the `Greeter` contract.

Let's refactor our test file with the provided script:

::drop-panel
  ::panel{label="test/main.test.ts"}
    ```typescript [main.test.ts]
    import { expect } from "chai";
    import { Wallet, Provider, Contract } from "zksync-ethers";
    import * as hre from "hardhat";
    import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync";
    import { zkSyncTestnet } from "../hardhat.config";

    const RICH_WALLET_PK = "0x7726827caac94a7f9e1b160f7ea819f172f7b6f9d2a97f992c38edeab82d4110";

    // Deploy the Greeter contract
    async function deployGreeter(deployer: Deployer): Promise<Contract> {
      // Load the Greeter contract artifact
      const artifact = await deployer.loadArtifact("Greeter");
      // Deploy the contract with an initial greeting
      return await deployer.deploy(artifact, ["Hi"]);
    }

    describe("Greeter", function () {
      let greeter;
      let wallet;
      let deployer;

      // Initialize commonly used variables before running the tests
      before(async function () {
        // Create a provider connected to the ZKsync testnet
        const provider = new Provider(zkSyncTestnet.url);

        // Create a wallet instance using the rich wallet's private key
        wallet = new Wallet(RICH_WALLET_PK, provider);
        // Create a deployer instance for contract deployments
        deployer = new Deployer(hre, wallet);
        // Deploy the Greeter contract
        greeter = await deployGreeter(deployer);
      });

      // Test the greet() function
      it("Should return the new greeting once it's changed", async function () {
        // Ensure the greet function returns the initial greeting after deployment
        expect(await greeter.greet()).to.eq("Hi");
      });

      // Test the setGreeting() function
      it("Should set a new greeting and return it", async function () {
        // Set a new greeting
        const setGreetingTx = await greeter.setGreeting("Hola, mundo!");
        // Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
        await setGreetingTx.wait();

        // Ensure the greet function returns the newly set greeting
        expect(await greeter.greet()).to.equal("Hola, mundo!");
      });

      // Test for lack of funds (or other tx failures)
      it("Should fail when insufficient funds", async function () {
        // Create an empty wallet with no funds
        const userWallet = Wallet.createRandom();
        // Connect the empty wallet to the greeter contract and attempt to set a new greeting
        try {
          await greeter.connect(userWallet).setGreeting("fail");
          // The following line should not be reached if the transaction fails
          expect(true).to.equal(false);
        } catch (e) {
          // Expect an error to be thrown for the transaction
          expect(e).to.exist;
        }
      });

      // Test event emission
      it("Should emit an event when the greeting is changed", async function () {
        const newGreeting = "Bonjour, monde!";
        // Use the provided .emit method to test event emissions
        await expect(greeter.setGreeting(newGreeting)).to.emit(greeter, "GreetingChanged").withArgs(newGreeting);
      });
    });
    ```

To run this test:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn test
```

```bash [npm]
npm test
```

```bash [bun]
bun run test
```

You should see the following output:

```sh
  Greeter
    ✔ Should return the new greeting once it's changed (211ms)
    ✔ Should set a new greeting and return it (2682ms)
    ✔ Should fail when insufficient funds (299ms)
    ✔ Should emit an event when the greeting is changed (2939ms)

  4 passing (6s)
```

## Understanding the test file

Have a look at the `test/main.test.ts` file's imports:

```typescript [test/main.test.ts]
import { expect } from "chai";
import { Wallet, Provider, Contract } from "zksync-ethers";
import * as hre from "hardhat";
import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync";
import { zkSyncTestnet } from "../hardhat.config";
```

This section imports all necessary utilities and configurations needed to run our tests.

- `expect` from Chai provides assertion functionalities for our tests.
- `Wallet`, `Provider`, and `Contract` from `zksync-ethers` help us with ZKsync functionalities like creating wallets and interacting with contracts.
- `hre` and `Deployer` give us hardhat specific functionalities for deploying and interacting with our contract.
- `zkSyncTestnet` from our hardhat configuration provides network details of our running `era_test_node.`

#### Contract Deployment Utility

```javascript
async function deployGreeter(deployer: Deployer): Promise<Contract> { ... }
```

This utility function simplifies deploying the Greeter contract for our tests.

#### Main Test Suite

```javascript
describe('Greeter', function () {
  ...
});
```

Here, we've declared our main test suite.
Each test or nested suite inside provides specific scenarios or functionalities we want to test regarding the Greeter contract.

1. **Initialization**

    Before running any test, we initialize commonly used variables like the provider, wallet, deployer, and the greeter contract.

2. **Test greet() function**

    We check that the greet function returns the initial greeting of 'Hi' after deployment.

    ```javascript
    it("Should return the new greeting once it's changed", async function () { ... });
    ```

3. **Test setGreeting() function**

    We test that setting a new greeting updates the contract's state as expected.

    ```javascript
    it("Should set a new greeting and return it", async function () { ... });
    ```

4. **Test insufficient funds**

    Here, we simulate a scenario where an empty wallet (with no funds) tries to set a new greeting.
    We make use of the `connect` method on your `zksync-ethers` Contract object to connect it to a different account.

    ```javascript
    it("Should fail when insufficient funds", async function () { ... });
    ```

5. **Test event emission**

    We test the emission of an event when the greeting changes in the contract making use of the `hardhat-chai-matchers`.

    ```javascript
    it("Should emit an event when the greeting is changed", async function () { ... });
    ```
