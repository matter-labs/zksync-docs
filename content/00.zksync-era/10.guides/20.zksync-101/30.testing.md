## Takeaways

- **Testing**: Understanding contract testing is important for ensuring the reliability and security of your smart contracts
on ZKsync. Proper testing safeguards against unforeseen errors and vulnerabilities.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Achieving comprehensive test coverage, including both positive and negative testing
scenarios, is essential for a robust smart contract. This guide emphasized the `contribute` method,
but testing should encompass all aspects of your contract.
- **Tooling Efficiency**: Leveraging Hardhat for testing provides a streamlined and efficient workflow.
These tools offer powerful features and plugins, like `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers`,
that enhance the testing process.

## Next Steps

With a solid foundation in contract testing, you're well-equipped to advance your ZKsync
development journey. Consider the following steps to further your expertise:
