description: Learn to build and deploy smart contracts on ZKsync Era.
---

Welcome to ZKsync 101 for deploying smart contracts on ZKsync!
In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating and deploying a simple smart contract that creates a crowdfunding campaign for Zeek.

By the end of the series, you will learn integral pieces that will
help you become a great developer on ZKsync! You will learn how to:

:check-icon Initialize a new project with ZKsync CLI.

:check-icon Deploy contracts on ZKsync Era using Hardhat.

:check-icon Test your contracts with Hardhat.

:check-icon Implement upgradable patterns for your contracts.

:check-icon Implement a Paymaster to simplify transactions for your users.

## Install ZKsync CLI

Our 101 series utilizes ZKsync CLI to help you develop and interact with ZKsync from your local machine.
We will use the full features of ZKsync CLI to build and deploy contracts in a local ZKsync Era node.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js v18 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git)

Open a terminal and install ZKsync CLI with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g zksync-cli
```

## Setup local node

This series of guides will use an in memory node which allows for quicker testing and debugging processes.
A great benefit of using a local node is that you will avoid incurring any actual transaction costs.
ZKsync Era node provides a set of rich wallets that come with more than enough ETH to use for development.

### Run a local in memory node

To run a local in memory node on your machine, you will need Docker running.
The easiest way to start Docker is to run the Docker Desktop app.

We are going to use the "In memory node" module for our local node setup.

1. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    zksync-cli dev config
    ```

    It will provide a list of available node types you can run locally.

2. Use the arrow keys to navigate to "In memory node" and press **Enter** to select.
    The next question will ask what additional modules you want to use.
    Make sure additional modules are unselected for this setup and press **Enter** to finish the configuration.

    ```bash
    ? Node to use (Use arrow keys)
    ‚ùØ In memory node - Quick startup, no persisted state, only L2 node - zkcli-in-memory-node
      Dockerized node - Persistent state, includes L1 and L2 nodes - zkcli-dockerized-node
    (Move up and down to reveal more choices)
    ```

    The in memory node module will run a lighter version of the ZKsync Era node
    which is ideal for swift testing, prototyping, bootloader and system contract testing.

3. Run the following command in your terminal to start up the node:

    ```bash
    zksync-cli dev start
    ```

    The in memory node includes pre-configured rich wallets for use, see [in-memory-node rich wallets](/build/test-and-debug/in-memory-node#pre-configured-rich-wallets).

Your in memory node is accessible at **[http://127.0.0.1:8011](http://127.0.0.1:8011/)**, ready for deployment or testing purposes.
You can use the Docker Desktop app to view logs from the running ZKsync Era node or use the `zksync-cli dev logs` command.
When you are done running your in memory node, you can stop it with `zksync-cli dev stop`.
You can learn more about managing a local node with ZKsync CLI on [Running a node](/build/zksync-cli/running-a-node).

## Create the ZKsync 101 project

We have a template available for you to get started with quickly in the ZKsync 101 series.
In a directory where you want to create your project, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
zksync-cli create zksync-101 --template zksync-101
```

After you run the `create` command, the CLI will download and install packages for the project.
You should see a success message and instructions to get started with your project.

Since we are using a local in memory node for development, we can use one of the
rich wallets for transactions and deployments.

Rename the `.env.example` to `.env` which includes the private key for the first rich wallet.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
Never save a real private key to the `.env` file!

## Next Steps

You should now have a fully working local environment to build new projects on ZKsync!

- Continue to the next step, [Hello ZKsync!](/build/start-coding/zksync-101/hello-zksync) to begin the 101 series
  on building a crowdfunding campaign for Zeek.
- This setup provides you everything you need to build on ZKsync Era.
- You can skip this 101 series to go on to [creating your own projects using ZKsync CLI](/build/zksync-cli/creating-projects).
