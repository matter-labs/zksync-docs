This tutorial shows you how to deploy and interact with a smart contract on ZKsync Era in less than 5 minutes.
It will help you get familiar with the ZKsync smart contract development and deployment process using different tools.

In this section you will learn how to:

:check-icon Build a smart contract to exchange messages with Zeek.

:check-icon Deploy the smart contract to the %%zk_testnet_name%%.

:check-icon Interact with the contract from your browser using Remix or Atlas.

## Prerequisites

1. Before you start, make sure that
[you’ve configured the %%zk_testnet_name%% in your wallet](/zksync-era/environment).
2. Have at least 0.5 %%zk_testnet_name%% ETH. If you need more, use [one of the faucets](/zksync-era/ecosystem/network-faucets).

## Review the smart contract code

The smart contract will store messages from users and emit events with replies from Zeek.
The entire code is as follows:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract ZeekMessages {
    string[] private messages;

    // Event to acknowledge a new message
    event MessageReceived(string);

    constructor() {
        // Zeek initializes the contract with a welcome message
        emit MessageReceived("Zeek welcomes you to ZKsync!");
    }

    function sendMessage(string memory _message) public {
        messages.push(_message);

        // Acknowledge the message receipt with Zeek's reply
        emit MessageReceived("ZK is the endgame - Message received!");
    }

    // Function to count the total messages sent to Zeek
    function getTotalMessages() public view returns (uint) {
        return messages.length;
    }

    // Function to return the last message sent to Zeek
    function getLastMessage() public view returns (string memory) {
        require(messages.length > 0, "No messages sent to Zeek yet!");
        return messages[messages.length - 1];
    }
}

```

The Solidity smart contract contains two functions:

- `sendMessage` stores the messages sent by users in the `messages` state variable.
- `getTotalMessages` returns the number of messages stored in the smart contract.
- `getLastMessage` returns the last message sent.

ZKsync Era is [EVM compatible](/zksync-protocol/glossary#evm-compatible).
You can write smart contracts with Solidity or Vyper and use existing popular libraries like OpenZeppelin, just like on Ethereum.

## Compile and deploy the contract

To compile and deploy the contract you can use either Atlas or Remix:

::content-switcher
---
items: [{
  label: 'Atlas',
  partial: '_deploy_first/_atlas_deploy_contract'
}, {
  label: 'Remix',
  partial: '_deploy_first/_remix_deploy_contract'
}]
---
::

## Check the contract in explorer

Copy the smart contract address from Atlas/Remix and search it via the [%%zk_testnet_name%%
explorer](%%zk_testnet_block_explorer_url%%). You’ll see the contract has a transaction from the message you just sent.

The status will be “Processed” on ZKsync Era and “Sending” on Ethereum. [Learn more about the transaction lifecycle on ZKsync](/zksync-protocol/rollup/transaction-lifecycle).

In the “Contract” tab you’ll see the contract source code as Atlas and Remix automatically verified the contract for us.
When a smart contract is verified in a block explorer, it means that the source code of the contract has been published
and matched to the compiled version on the blockchain enhancing transparency, as users can review the contract’s source
code to understand its functions and intentions.

Finally in the “Events” tab, you’ll see the replies from Zeek as these are emitted as events in our smart contract.

ZK is the endgame ✌️

## Takeaways

- **EVM-compatibility**: ZKsync Era is EVM-compatible and you can write smart contracts in Solidity or Vyper as in
  Ethereum.
- **Custom compilers**: smart contracts deployed to ZKsync Era must be compiled with the customs compilers: `zksolc` for
  Solidity and `zkvyper` for Vyper.
- **Browser-based IDEs**: Existing tools like Atlas and Remix use ZKsync custom compilers under the hood.
