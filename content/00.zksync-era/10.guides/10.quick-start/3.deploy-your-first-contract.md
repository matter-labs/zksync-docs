title: Deploy your first contract
description: Deploy a smart contract to ZKsync from your browser using Remix in under 5 minutes
---

This tutorial shows you how to deploy and interact with a smart contract on ZKsync Era in less than 5 minutes.
It will help you get familiar with the ZKsync smart contract development and deployment process using different tools.

In this section you will learn how to:

:check-icon Build a smart contract to exchange messages with Zeek.

:check-icon Deploy the smart contract to the %%zk_testnet_name%%.

:check-icon Interact with the contract from your browser using Remix.

## Prerequisites

1. Before you start, make sure that
[you’ve configured the %%zk_testnet_name%% in your wallet](/zksync-era/environment).
2. Have at least 0.05 %%zk_testnet_name%% ETH. If you need more, use [one of the faucets](/zksync-era/ecosystem/network-faucets).

## Review the smart contract code

The smart contract will store messages from users and emit events with replies from Zeek.
The entire code is as follows:

```solidity
:code-import{filePath="hardhat-sol/contracts/ZeekMessages.sol"}
```

The Solidity smart contract contains three functions:

- `sendMessage` stores the messages sent by users in the `messages` state variable.
- `getTotalMessages` returns the number of messages stored in the smart contract.
- `getLastMessage` returns the last message sent.

## Compile and deploy the contract

To compile and deploy the contract you can use either EVM or EraVM bytecode:

:display_partial{path="/_partials/_eravm_vs_evm"}

items: [{
  label: 'EVM',
  partial: '_deploy_first/_evm_remix_deploy_contract'
}, {
  label: 'EraVM',
  partial: '_deploy_first/_eravm_remix_deploy_contract'
}]
---
::

Finally in the “Events” tab, you’ll see the replies from Zeek as these are emitted as events in our smart contract.

ZK is the endgame ✌️

## Takeaways

- **EVM-compatibility**: ZKsync Era is EVM-compatible and you can write smart contracts in Solidity or Vyper as in
  Ethereum.
- **Custom compilers**: smart contracts deployed to ZKsync Era can either be compiled as EVM using default compilers and tools,
  or EraVM with the custom compilers:
  `zksolc` for Solidity and `zkvyper` for Vyper.
- **Browser-based IDEs**: You can use existing tools like Remix to deploy EVM or EraVM contracts.
