title: Deploy your first contract
description: Deploy a smart contract to ZKsync from your browser using Remix in under 5 minutes
---

This tutorial shows you how to deploy and interact with a smart contract on ZKsync Era in less than 5 minutes.
It will help you get familiar with the ZKsync smart contract development and deployment process using different tools.

In this section you will learn how to:

:check-icon Build a smart contract to exchange messages with Zeek.

:check-icon Deploy the smart contract to the %%zk_testnet_name%%.

:check-icon Interact with the contract from your browser using Remix.

## Prerequisites

1. Before you start, make sure that
[you’ve configured the %%zk_testnet_name%% in your wallet](/zksync-era/environment).
2. Have at least 0.05 %%zk_testnet_name%% ETH. If you need more, use [one of the faucets](/zksync-era/ecosystem/network-faucets).

## Review the smart contract code

The smart contract will store messages from users and emit events with replies from Zeek.
The entire code is as follows:

```solidity
:code-import{filePath="hardhat-sol/contracts/ZeekMessages.sol"}
```

The Solidity smart contract contains two functions:

- `sendMessage` stores the messages sent by users in the `messages` state variable.
- `getTotalMessages` returns the number of messages stored in the smart contract.
- `getLastMessage` returns the last message sent.

## Compile and deploy the contract

To compile and deploy the contract you can use either EVM or EraVM:

:display_partial{path="/_partials/_eravm_vs_evm"}

  label: 'EVM',
  partial: '_deploy_first/_evm_remix_deploy_contract'
}, {
  label: 'EraVM',
  partial: '_deploy_first/_eravm_remix_deploy_contract'
}]

The status will be “Processed” on ZKsync Era and “Sending” on Ethereum. [Learn more about the transaction lifecycle on ZKsync](/zksync-protocol/rollup/transaction-lifecycle).

In the “Contract” tab you’ll see the contract source code as Remix automatically verified the contract for us.
When a smart contract is verified in a block explorer, it means that the source code of the contract has been published
and matched to the compiled version on the blockchain enhancing transparency, as users can review the contract’s source
code to understand its functions and intentions.

Finally in the “Events” tab, you’ll see the replies from Zeek as these are emitted as events in our smart contract.

ZK is the endgame ✌️

## Takeaways

- **EVM-compatibility**: ZKsync Era is EVM-compatible and you can write smart contracts in Solidity or Vyper as in
  Ethereum.
- **Custom compilers**: smart contracts deployed to ZKsync Era can either be compiled as EVM or EraVM with the custom compilers:
  `zksolc` for Solidity and `zkvyper` for Vyper.
- **Browser-based IDEs**: You can use existing tools like Remix to deploy EVM or EraVM contracts.
