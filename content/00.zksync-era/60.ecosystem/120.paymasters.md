# Paymasters

Paymasters are specialized accounts designed to subsidize transaction fees for users, enhancing usability and flexibility within protocols. They also facilitate the payment of fees using ERC20 tokens, instead of the default ETH.

### ZyFi

The main focus of Zyfi revolves around paymasters and the features they offer. From allowing users to pay with any ERC-20 token (currently more than 80) enabling specific sponsorship logic with Sybil prevention and dashboard analytics, Zyfi helps deliver the best gas abstraction experience for users and Dapps.

All is powered by an API that takes less than a day to implement, abstracting the complexities away from protocols so they can focus on building their products. Zyfi has processed over 3M sponsored transactions and is integrated with more than 30 DApps on ZK chains across various sectors, including PancakeSwap (DEX), ZeroLend (Supply & Borrow), SyncSwap (DEX), Gravita (CDP), Increment Fi (Perp), and zkMarkets (NFT marketplace), with many more in the pipeline.
