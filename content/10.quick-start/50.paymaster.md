Welcome to the final part of our Quickstart Series on mastering zkSync development!
In this guide, we move beyond the basics
of smart contract deployment and the creation of contract factories to explore the innovative concept of paymasters
in the zkSync ecosystem. This guide will illuminate the power of paymasters to revolutionize transaction
fee management and enhance user experiences within your dApps.

fees in ERC20 tokens on zkSync Era, using Hardhat or Foundry.

Embark on this journey to understand how paymasters can add a new layer of functionality and user-friendliness
to your decentralized applications.

## What are Paymasters?

Paymasters in the zkSync ecosystem represent a groundbreaking approach to handling transaction fees.
They are special accounts designed to subsidize transaction costs for other accounts, potentially making
certain transactions free for end-users. This feature is particularly useful for dApp developers looking
to improve their platform's accessibility and user experience by covering transaction fees on behalf of their users.

## Built-in Paymaster Flows

Paymasters can operate under various flows, some of which may require user interaction, such as setting allowances
for token swaps. These flows enable paymasters to support a wide range of use cases, from simple fee subsidies
to more complex scenarios involving ERC20 token exchanges for transaction fees.

- **General Paymaster Flow:** This default flow requires no preliminary actions from users, allowing paymasters
to interpret transaction data as needed to cover fees.

- **Approval-Based Paymaster Flow:** For operations requiring user permissions, such as token allowances,
this flow provides a structured approach. It ensures that user tokens can be seamlessly exchanged for transaction
fees, subject to user-approved limits.

As we explore paymasters, remember that while they offer enhanced flexibility for fee management, their
implementation should always prioritize security and user trust. This guide aims to equip you with the knowledge
to effectively incorporate paymasters into your zkSync projects, paving the way for more user-friendly and accessible dApps.
