## Takeaways

- **EVM Compatibility:** zkSync is EVM compatible and you can write smart contracts in Solidity or Vyper.
- **Development Tools:** zkSync supports your favorite development toolkit Hardhat and Foundry.
- **Custom Compilation:** Contracts deployed to zkSync are compiled using `zksolc` or `zkvyper` as
they generate a special bytecode for zkSync's ZKEVM.

## Next steps

Having successfully deployed your first contract on zkSync, you're well on your way to becoming
a proficient zkSync developer. To expand your expertise:

- **Explore Contract Factories:** Enhance your project by building a contract factory
for the `CrowdfundingCampaign` contract in the next guide. This will allow you to efficiently
manage multiple crowdfunding campaigns, each with its own unique parameters.
- **Dive Deeper into zkSync Features:** Investigate advanced zkSync features such as account abstraction,
and paymasters.
- **Join the Community:** Engage with the zkSync developer community through forums,
Discord channels, Dev Discussions, or GitHub repositories. Share your experiences, ask questions,
and collaborate on projects.
