## Covalent

[Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/docs/networks/zksync-era/) provides the industry-leading
Unified API bringing visibility to billions of Web3 data points. Developers use Covalent to
build exciting multi-chain applications like crypto wallets, NFT galleries, and investor dashboard tools utilizing data.

## DipDup

[DipDup](https://dipdup.io/) is a Python framework for building smart contract indexers. It
helps developers focus on business logic instead of writing a boilerplate to store and serve
data. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which means only required data is requested. This
approach allows to achieve faster indexing times and decreased load on underlying APIs.

## Dune

[Dune](https://dune.com/home) is a powerful data indexing service for blockchain,
providing a comprehensive platform to query, visualize, share, and export data across 30+ blockchains.
It enables users to collaboratively build and analyze blockchain data with the support of Web3's largest data community,
making it an essential tool for anyone involved in the crypto space.

## Envio

[Envio](https://envio.dev/) is a feature-rich data indexing solution &
data provider, offering a seamless and efficient way to index, aggregate, and query real-time or historical blockchain data for any EVM.
Using HyperSync, application developers can retrieve logs, blocks, transactions, and traces up to 1000x faster than RPC.

## Flair

[Flair](https://docs.flair.dev/) offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as
fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors, re-org aware database integrations)
to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

## Goldsky

[Goldsky](https://goldsky.com/) is a data indexer for web3 builders,
offering high-performance subgraph hosting and realtime data replication pipelines.
Goldsky offers two core self-serve products, Subgraphs and Mirror,
that can be used independently or in conjunction to power your data stack.

## Graph Network

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying
blockchain data. The Graph makes it possible to query data that is difficult to query directly.
Use The Graph network today to index protocol data on ZKsync!

## Space & Time

[Space and Time](https://www.spaceandtime.io/) is the verifiable compute layer that scales
zero-knowledge proofs on a decentralized data warehouse to deliver trustless data processing to
smart contracts, LLMs, and enterprises. Space and Time joins indexed blockchain data from major chains with offchain datasets.

## SubQuery Network

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a fast, flexible, and reliable open-source data
indexer that provides you with custom APIs for your web3 project across all of our supported
chains.

## Subsquid

[Subsquid](https://subsquid.io/) is a decentralized indexing toolkit optimized for batch
extraction of large volumes of data. It currently serves historical on-chain data including
event logs, transaction receipts, traces and per-transaction state diffs. Subsquid offers a
powerful toolkit for creating custom data extraction and  processing pipelines, achieving
indexing speeds of up to 150k blocks per second.
