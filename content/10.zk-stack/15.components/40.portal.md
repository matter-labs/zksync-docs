[The Portal](https://github.com/matter-labs/dapp-portal) is an application designed to enhance interaction with your ZKsync chain.
It serves as a versatile tool for both you and your users, simplifying various operations within the blockchain environment.

You can see a live instance of the portal for ZKsync Era at [`https://portal.zksync.io`](https://portal.zksync.io).

Instructions for how to set up a local portal can be found in the ["Using a Local ZK Chain"](/zk-stack/running/using-a-local-zk-chain#using-the-portal)
docs.

### Key Features

- **Bridging Assets:** The Portal enables the movement of assets between the Layer 1 (L1) network and your ZKsync chain, facilitating smooth asset transfers.
- **Internal Transactions:** Users can send assets within the ZKsync chain efficiently, utilizing the Portal's user-friendly interface.
- **Transaction History:** The Portal provides access to view and verify historical transactions, enhancing transparency and user trust in the platform.
- **Contract Management:** It supports users in managing smart contracts, including deployment and interaction functionalities.

Enhancing the Portal's capabilities is possible by integrating it with the [Block Explorer Indexer/API](/zk-stack/components/block-explorer),
which provides additional data and analytics support, further enriching the user experience.
