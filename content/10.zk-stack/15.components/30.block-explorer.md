[The Block Explorer](https://github.com/matter-labs/block-explorer)
is a tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into all activities occurring on a ZKsync chain.
This tool is especially useful for users and developers who need to monitor or interact with the blockchain. Block Explorer consists of three main components:

- **Block Explorer Worker:**
  This indexer service manages ZKsync chain data.
  Its main role is to collect data from the blockchain in real time, process this data, and populate a database that supports the API.

- **Block Explorer API:**
  This component offers an HTTP API to access structured data from the ZKsync chain.
  It retrieves data from the database maintained by the Block Explorer Worker.

- **Block Explorer App:**
  This is the user interface that enables users and developers to navigate and examine transactions,
  blocks, batches, contracts, tokens, and other elements within the ZKsync chain.

Instructions for how to set up a local block explorer
can be found in the ["Using a Local ZK Chain"](/zk-stack/running/using-a-local-zk-chain#using-a-block-explorer) docs.
