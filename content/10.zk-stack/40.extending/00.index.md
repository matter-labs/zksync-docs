ZK Stack framework provides many abilities to customize your chain, such as ability to switch between Rollup and Validium, choose a different base
token, and others described in the [Running](/zk-stack/running) sections.

However, the extensibility doesn't end here. It's possible to customize your chain even more, although it would require more effort.
