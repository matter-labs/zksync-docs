## Managing Users

Users represent individual identities that can access your Prividium network.
Each user can authenticate through **Okta**, a **crypto wallet**, or both.
Administrators manage users from the **Admin Dashboard**.

### 1. Open the Users page

1. Go to the **Admin Dashboard** at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Select **Users** from the sidebar.
3. Review the list of users, linked wallets, and assigned roles.

### 2. Add a new user

1. Click **Add User**.
2. Enter details:
   - **Name** (optional display name)
   - **Email or Okta ID** if using Okta
   - **Wallet address** if using SIWE
3. Assign one or more **roles** to define access.
4. Click **Save**.

The user can now log in through the **User Dashboard** at `http://localhost:3001` with their configured method.

### 3. Edit an existing user

1. Find the user in the list and click **Edit**.
2. Update **email**, **wallets**, or **roles**.
3. Click **Save**.

> Note: If a user is synced from Okta, the Okta ID is controlled by your IdP and cannot be changed in the Admin Dashboard.

### 4. Remove a user

1. Locate the user and select **Remove User**.
2. Confirm the deletion.

Removing a user also revokes their linked wallets and role assignments.
If they authenticate again, Prividium creates a new user entry.

### 5. Link multiple wallets

You can link more than one wallet address to the same user.

1. Open **Users**, then click **Edit** on the target user.
2. In **Wallets**, select **Add Wallet**.
3. Enter the address and click **Save**.

All linked wallets inherit the same role-based permissions assigned to the user.

### 6. Assign roles to users

Roles determine what actions a user can perform on your Prividium network.
You can assign one or more roles to each user directly from the **Users** page.

1. Go to the **Users** page in the **Admin Dashboard**.
2. Click **Edit** next to the user’s name.
3. Under **Roles**, select one or more roles from the available list.
4. Click **Save** to apply changes.

Each user’s permissions are determined by the combined privileges of their assigned roles.
Changes take effect immediately, and users may need to refresh their session to see updated access.

> Tip: Use the **Roles** page to define or update role names before assigning them here.

### 7. User types

| Type | Authentication | Managed From | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------------|-------|
| **Okta user** | Okta SSO | Okta and Admin Dashboard | Linked by Okta subject ID |
| **Wallet user** | SIWE | Admin Dashboard | Identified by wallet address |
| **Hybrid user** | Okta and SIWE | Admin Dashboard | Can use either method to log in |

### Tips

- Use **roles** to group access by responsibility, then assign users to those roles.
- Keep at least two **Admin** users to avoid lockout.
- For production, restrict who can add or remove users through role policy.

### Next Step

Continue to [Selective Disclosure](./selective-disclosure.md) to configure which onchain data can be publicly viewed without authentication.
