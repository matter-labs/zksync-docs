title: Validium in ZK Stack
description: Dive deeper into the ZK Stack's Validiums, learn how to operate and configure them.
---

This section provides an in-depth exploration of Validiums in ZK Stack. For more general overview of Validiums,
see [here](../05.concepts/60.data-availability/20.validiums.md).

## What kinds of Validium are there

We define 3 different kinds of Validiums based on the level of data availability they provide:

- **Stage 0** - the simplest type of Validium that only stores the pubdata in the database of the node(s) running the
  chain
- **Stage 1** - a Validium that only sends the data to the DA layer, but doesn’t verify its inclusion
- **Stage 2** - a Validium that sends the data to the DA layer, and also verifies its inclusion on L1 either by using
  the verification bridges or zk-proofs directly.

There are multiple DA layers that we are going to integrate with, the first on the list are:
[Avail](https://www.availproject.org/), [Celestia](https://celestia.org/), [EigenDA](https://www.eigenda.xyz/).

## Server-related details

Getting a bit deeper into the technicalities, the process of persisting the pubdata in the different DA layers is
handled by two components: DA dispatcher and DA client:

- DA client’s role is to abstract the access to the DA layer and generalize it to 2 functions: `dispatch_blob`
  and `get_inclusion_data`. Clients are a part of the `zksync-era` repository, see the
  code [here](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/main/core/node/da_clients/src).
- DA dispatcher is responsible for periodically fetching the pubdata from the database, and calling the DA client either
  to dispatch a blob or get an inclusion proofs. It also handles retries in case the client function call failed with a
  retryable error.

The DA related information is stored in the `data_availability` table in the database, Validium’s new batches can’t be
committed if their inclusion data in that table is NULL.

**Configuration**

The Validium chain is required to have the following configuration:

1. Set a pubdata sending mode [general.yaml]
    - `pubdata_sending_mode: CUSTOM`
2. Configure DA dispatcher (reference values below) [general.yaml]

    ```yaml
    da_dispatcher:
      polling_interval_ms: 5000
      max_rows_to_dispatch: 100
      max_retries: 5
    ```

3. Add DA client’s config and secrets, [see FAQ for details](#faq).

All the configs can also be set using environment variables instead of `.yaml` files, but it is less preferred.

## Smart contracts

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
DA inclusion verification contracts are only going to be available in ZK Gateway release, which is planned to go live in Q1 2025.
::

The DA inclusion verification consist of 2 different steps, with a corresponding smart contract responsible for each of
them:

1. Committing to the pubdata - L2DAValidator
2. Using a commitment and a data provided by the operator to verify that the pubdata was included in the DA layer -
   L1DAValidator

The commitment is passed from `L2DAValidator` to `L1DAValidator` via L2→L1 logs, this happens within the system
contracts’ execution, so this process can be trusted as it is covered by ZK proof. The format of the commitment is
arbitrary, it is up to the `L2DAValidator` to decide what is the one that suits the specific DA layer the most.

The `L1DAValidator` implementations may have different logic from DA layer to DA layer, our protocol only requires it to
return whether the commitment and proof pair is valid. There are 2 approaches that can be used here: verification
bridges and ZK poofs.

- **Verification bridges:** these are the smart contracts that gets updated with the state roots of the specific DA
  layers. They utilize the ZK proofs to verify the validity of the provided state roots. Later on, the verification
  bridges are called from `L1DAValidator` contract and normally use Merkle-proofs to verify against the known state
  roots.
- **ZK proofs:** similarly to the verification bridges, we can utilize ZK proofs here, but directly in
  the `L1DAValidator`. If we go a step further and do the ZK proof that has the following
  - complete the asserts that verification bridges do to ensure the validity of the state root
  - verify that the pubdata commitment relates to the data included in the data root of some specific block
  - verify that the data root is included in the state root

  we would be able to only verify that proof without the need for additional checks against the bridges. This solution
  is especially relevant with DA layers that use the commitments that are inefficient to produce on L2.

The chain operator would be able to change the implementations of the L1/L2DAValidators, which allows for applying
updates/optimizations or completely changing the DA verification logic, e.g. due to migration to the different DA layer.

### FAQ

<details>
<summary>How do I set up the new Validium chain locally?</summary>

1. Install `zkstack` following [this](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/main/zkstack_cli) guide
2. `zkstack dev clean all` - to make sure you have an empty setup
3. `zkstack containers` - this creates the necessary docker containers
4. `zkstack ecosystem init` - init a default ecosystem (go with default options everywhere)
5. `zkstack chain create` - create a new chain, stick to the default options, but select Validium when prompted, use this
  chain as default (the last question there)
6. `zkstack chain init` - init the new chain
7. configure the client, see the sections below
8. `zkstack server --chain YOUR_CHAIN_NAME` - run the server

<summary>How to configure Avail client?</summary>

1. Add the following block to the `general.yaml`, values used are only an example:
    - Full client:

       ```yaml
       da_client:

<details>
<summary>Is it possible to switch DA layers?</summary>

Yes, it is possible.

- For stage 0 and stage 1 Validiums it is enough to change the client configuration and secrets.
- For stage 2 Validiums, the operator would need to deploy new L1/L2DAValidator contracts and change their addresses
  in the contracts that call them.

The exact details will be provided later, when the process is fully established.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is it possible to transition from Validium to Rollup and vice versa?</summary>

Yes, it is possible, the process would be the same as switching DA layers.

Rollup L1/L2 DA validators are the same kind of contracts as the Validium ones, as they are also an implementations of
the same interface,
so the procedure wouldn't differ a lot.
