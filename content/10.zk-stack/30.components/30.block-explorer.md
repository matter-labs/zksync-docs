[The Block Explorer](https://github.com/matter-labs/block-explorer)
is a tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into all activities occurring on a ZK chain.
This tool is especially useful for users and developers who need to monitor or interact with the blockchain. Block Explorer consists of three main components:

- **Block Explorer Worker:**
  This indexer service manages ZK chain data.
  Its main role is to collect data from the blockchain in real time, process this data, and populate a database that supports the API.

- **Block Explorer API:**
  This component offers an HTTP API to access structured data from the ZK chain.
  It retrieves data from the database maintained by the Block Explorer Worker.

- **Block Explorer App:**
  This is the user interface that enables users and developers to navigate and examine transactions,
  blocks, batches, contracts, tokens, and other elements within the ZK chain.
