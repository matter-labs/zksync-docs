This section provides a high-level overview of the components that form ZKsync Chain.
It aims to cover the _dynamic_ parts, such as binaries or front-end applications. As such, it does not focus on components like smart contracts
and virtual machine overview. To get more details on those, see the [Protocol documentation](/zksync-protocol).

The main components of each ZKsync chain are:

- [Server](/zk-stack/components/server): The modular sequencer node implementation.
- [Prover](/zk-stack/components/prover): A horizontally scalable implementation of ZK proof generator.
- [Block Explorer](/zk-stack/components/block-explorer)
- [Portal/Wallet/Bridge](/zk-stack/components/portal-wallet-bridge)
- [Fee Withdrawer](/zk-stack/components/fee-withdrawer)
