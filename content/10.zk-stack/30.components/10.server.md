description: Overview of the sequencer node implementation.
---

The ZKsync Sequencer is a complex system composed of several services and modules that work together to monitor Ethereum Layer 1 (L1),
maintain Layer 2 (L2) state, and manage the order of incoming transactions.

The code for the server can be found in the [ZKsync Era GitHub repository](%%zk_git_repo_zksync-era%%).

More technical documentation for the server can be found in the [ZKsync Core book](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/core/latest/).

## Components

The server implementation consists of multiple modules, which can run either as a monolithic application or as a set of microservices.

Main server components are:

- [State keeper](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/state_keeper): The sequencer.
- [API](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/api_server): Implementation of the Web3 JSON-RPC API.
- [Metadata calculator](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/metadata_calculator): Implementation of the ZKsync
  Merkle tree with extensions required for ZKP generation.
- [ETH sender](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/eth_sender): Component responsible for submitting
  commit/prove/execute operations to L1.
- [ETH watcher](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/eth_watch): Component responsible for listening for
  updated on the L1 contract.
- [Proof data handler](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/proof_data_handler): API for interacting with the
  prover subsystem.
