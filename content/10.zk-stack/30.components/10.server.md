description: Overview of the sequencer node implementation.
---

The ZKsync Sequencer is a complex system composed of several services and modules that work together to monitor Ethereum Layer 1 (L1),
maintain Layer 2 (L2) state, and manage the order of incoming transactions.

The code for the server can be found in the [ZKsync Era GitHub repository](%%zk_git_repo_zksync-era%%).

More technical documentation for the server can be found in the [ZKsync Core book](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/core/latest/).

## Using your chain RPC

Your server contains both HTTPS as well as WebSocket (WS) RPC services that are fully web3 compatible (and contain some extra ZK Stack functionalities).
Learn more on the [API reference page](/zksync-protocol/api).

## Components

The server implementation consists of multiple modules, which can run either as a monolithic application or as a set of microservices.

Main server components are:

- [State keeper](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/state_keeper): The sequencer.
- [API](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/api_server): Implementation of the Web3 JSON-RPC API.
- [Metadata calculator](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/metadata_calculator): Implementation of the ZKsync
  Merkle tree with extensions required for ZKP generation.
- [ETH sender](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/eth_sender): Component responsible for submitting
  commit/prove/execute operations to L1.
- [ETH watcher](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/eth_watch): Component responsible for listening for
  updated on the L1 contract.
- [Proof data handler](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-era/tree/core-v25.2.0/core/node/proof_data_handler): API for interacting with the
  prover subsystem.
