This section covers L1 and L2 contracts, their relationships, and the roles that manage them.

## Contracts overview

| Contract                     | Description | Owned by | Shared within ecosystem                                         | Source code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### FAQ

<details>
<summary>What powers does the governance have?</summary>

You can verify all of these by looking through the [ChainTypeManager.sol](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/tree/0fcc77c4f49d10efaaba4808b2c9b29a6fbfb232/l1-contracts/contracts/state-transition/ChainTypeManager.sol)
& [Bridgehub.sol](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/tree/0fcc77c4f49d10efaaba4808b2c9b29a6fbfb232/l1-contracts/contracts/bridgehub/Bridgehub.sol)
contracts.

- Add/remove a CTM to/from the bridgehub
- Register a new chain to the bridgehub
- For any ZK chain deployed on the bridgehub:
  - Upgrade the new protocol version and deadlines for upgrades
  - Freeze and unfreeze a chain
  - Change fee params
  - Set Validator

</details>

<details>
<summary>What powers does the chain admin have?</summary>

These are deducible from the [Admin facet](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/blob/0fcc77c4f49d10efaaba4808b2c9b29a6fbfb232/l1-contracts/contracts/state-transition/chain-deps/facets/Admin.sol),
the main ones are:

- change fee params
- set DA validators
- set TransactionFilterer contract on L1
- ETH ↔ CustomBaseToken ratio for L1->L2 transactions
- set pubdata pricing mode (Rollup/Validium)
- set the timestamp when the protocol upgrade will be applied

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why do these limitations exist? What are the benefits of being on the shared CTM?</summary>

By being on the shared CTM, chain operators get the below benefits:

1. Higher level of trust between chains that allows for proof-based interoperability and theoretically for commit- or TEE-based with additional limitations.
2. Security handling in case of critical bugs.
3. Upgrades managed by the CTM owner, (L1 contract upgrades done by owner, server+prover upgrades by the operator)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are there other limitations to being on the shared CTM?</summary>

Yes. You cannot modify the L2 system contracts and the bootloader, the VM and the circuits. If there is a protocol-level
feature you would want added, it would have to be added to the main repo and included in a protocol release.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the other options and what are their tradeoffs?</summary>

1. Launching off the shared bridge as a completely separate fork of the fully open source ZKsync era
2. Launching on the shared bridge using a different CTM (with permission by the governance)

</details>

<details>
<summary>If I start on the shared CTM, can I permissionlessly opt out?</summary>

Currently, no. This feature is on our roadmap

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do upgrades work in the shared CTMs and in external CTMs?</summary>

- In the shared CTM, the upgrades are proposed by the Governance. This also means that their deadlines are enforced by the governance.
- In the separate CTM scenario, the entity controlling the CTM can propose any upgrades they need and enforce any deadlines on them.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can the chain be started on a different CTM and join the shared CTM?</summary>

Using the standard process - no, because the historical state transitions are not validated, thus there are no guarantees of their correctness.

But it is possible to do via governance voting, which is not a standard procedure and takes some time to do.
