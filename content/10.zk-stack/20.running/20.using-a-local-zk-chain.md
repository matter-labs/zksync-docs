title: Using a local ZK Chain
description:
---

## Funding accounts

The first step to start interacting with your ZK chain is to fund an account (or a few).
This means you need some funds on the base layer.

During the `zkstack ecosystem create` configuration, you have a choice of what base layer to deploy the ZK chain onto:
a local reth node, or an Ethereum network (e.g., Sepolia).

### Base layer is the local reth node

If you choose to deploy on local [reth](https://ghcr.io/paradigmxyz/reth) node, you will have a set of addresses that have 100 ETH each.
You can find the list of rich wallets on GitHub in the [matter-labs/local-setup project](https://github.com/matter-labs/local-setup/blob/main/rich-wallets.json)
and use these addresses to deposit into your ZK chain via the bridge.

### Base layer is an Ethereum network (e.g., Sepolia)

If you choose to deploy on an Ethereum network (e.g., Sepolia), you need to have an account on the base layer with ETH.
You can use the deployer, governor, or operator wallets setup during the deployment process,
or any other wallet with funds, to deposit into your ZK chain via the bridge.

Once you have the accounts with funds on the L1 base layer, you can do a deposit via the bridge to your ZK chain,
and start interacting with your ZK chain using the L2 funded account.

## Using your chain RPC

Your server contains both HTTPS as well as WebSocket (WS) RPC services that are fully web3 compatible (and contain some extra ZK Stack functionalities).
Learn more on the [API reference page](/zksync-protocol/api).

## Using zksync-cli

[ZKsync CLI](/zksync-era/tooling/zksync-cli) allows you to easily interact and develop applications on your ZK chain.
When executing any command with ZKsync CLI, you can specify RPC urls for both L1 and L2.
Your local server contains RPCs for both.
An example deposit command via the bridge would look like:

```bash
zksync-cli bridge deposit --rpc=http://localhost:3050 --l1-rpc=http://localhost:8545
```

You can save the chain configurations for your ZK chain with ZKsync CLI by [adding a new configuration](/zksync-era/tooling/zksync-cli/configuring-chains).

## Using the Portal

The [Portal](https://github.com/matter-labs/dapp-portal) module is a web-app that allows you to:

- Bridge & transfer tokens to your ZK chain.
- View balances.
- Add contacts for quick and easy access.

Once you have at least one chain initialized, you can run the portal app locally:

```bash
zkstack portal
```

This command will start the dockerized portal app using configuration from `apps/portal.config.json` file inside your
ecosystem directory. You can edit this file to configure the portal app if needed.

You can now navigate to the portal web-app. By default, portal frontend starts on
`http://localhost:3030`, you can configure the port in `apps.yaml` file.

## Using a Block Explorer

A block explorer is a web-app that lets you view and inspect transactions, blocks,
contracts and more. A [free open source block explorer](https://github.com/matter-labs/block-explorer) is available for your ZK chain.

First, each chain should be initialized:

```bash
zkstack explorer init
```

This command creates a database to store explorer data and generates a docker compose file with explorer services
(`explorer-docker-compose.yml`).

Next, for each chain you want to have an explorer, you need to start its backend services:

```bash
zkstack explorer backend --chain <chain_name>
```

This command uses previously created docker compose file to start the services (api, data fetcher, worker) required for
the explorer.

Finally, you can run the explorer app:

```bash
zkstack explorer run
```

This command will start the dockerized explorer app using configuration from `apps/explorer.config.json` file inside
your ecosystem directory. You can edit this file to configure the app if needed.

You can now navigate to the explorer web-app. By default, explorer frontend starts on
`http://localhost:3010`, you can configure the port in `apps.yaml` file.
