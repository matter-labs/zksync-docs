## Enabling Boojum prover

With the default configuration, your ZK chain is not running a prover, and has a DummyExecutor contract,
which mainly “accepts” that a batch is executed without proof. This enables you to test it with much lower hardware requirements.

When enabling the Boojum prover, there are two options for running it: in GPU, or in CPU.

**Running a prover is not required** for deploying a testnet. The requirements below are only necessary if you want to enable the prover.

### Prover dependencies

Ensure you have installed:

- [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)
- [cmake](https://apt.kitware.com/)
- [nvcc (CUDA toolkit)](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

Refer to the [prover docs](https://matter-labs.github.io/zksync-era/prover/latest/) for more
information.

### Running the prover

To initialize the prover, first use the init command:

`zkstack prover init`

It will guide you through the necessary configuration.

Then to run the prover:

`zkstack prover run`

### Requirements for GPU prover

The docker compose file assumes you will be running all components in the same machine. The current minimum requirements for a low TPS scenario are:

- 6 GB VRAM NVIDIA GPU
- 16 Core CPU
- 64 GB of RAM
- 300 GB of Disk Space (SSD preferred)

### Requirements for CPU prover

The docker compose file assumes you will be running all components in the same machine.
The current minimum requirements for a low TPS scenario are:

- 32 Core CPU
- 128 GB of RAM
- 700 GB of Disk Space (SSD preferred)
