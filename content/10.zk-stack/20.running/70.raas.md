## Deploying and running using a Rollup as a Service provider

Launching a ZKsync-based chain involves a number of infrastructure and operational considerations — from sequencer management and data availability
to monitoring, scaling, and security.
To streamline this process, you can work with **Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS)** providers.

RaaS partners offer the infrastructure and tooling needed to **deploy, operate, and customize** your ZK Stack chain.
These providers handle much of the heavy lifting around setup and maintenance, allowing your team to focus on your protocol, product, and community.

We collaborate with multiple RaaS partners to ensure that projects can choose the setup that best fits their **technical, business, and
operational needs**. Whether you’re optimizing for scalability, flexibility, compliance, or time-to-market, you can select from a range
of providers with varying architectures, hosting options, and service models.

## Benefits of Using a RaaS Provider

- **Simplified deployment** and lifecycle management of your ZKsync chain.
- **Reliable infrastructure** and performance monitoring tools.
- **Reduced operational overhead** and faster development cycles.
- **Integration of specialized services** such as custom settings or data availability layers.
- **Flexibility and scalability** as your chain evolves .
