Prividium delivers private execution, enterprise-grade access control, and Ethereum-level security in a single composable stack.
It is the only solution available today that combines this level of confidentiality, auditability, and interoperability, without tradeoffs.

## Composable Privacy

Prividium operates as a **permissioned ZKsync Chain**, where transaction inputs, calldata,
and full state are stored off-chain in an operator-controlled database.
Only cryptographic commitments—state roots and STARK-based proofs—are submitted to Ethereum, ensuring public verifiability without exposing private data.

**Key capabilities:**

- Keep all data inside your infrastructure (no transaction details on Ethereum)
- Selectively mark contracts/methods as public, private, or role-gated via a policy file
- Update access settings without redeploying contracts
- Supply Merkle proofs or DB extracts for selective disclosure (e.g., audits, investigations)

**Design Summary:**

- **Data location:** Entire state is stored off-chain in a private database
- **Proofs:** Each block produces a STARK proof verified on Ethereum
- **External visibility:** L1 observers only see state roots, metadata, and proof hashes
- **Selective disclosure:** Auditors can view chain segments without affecting behavior

## Fine-Grained Access Control

All interactions with the chain are routed through a **Proxy RPC** that enforces access policies defined in a YAML configuration.

**Features:**

- Wallet address whitelisting.
- Define groups (e.g., traders, clients, auditors) and map them to specific methods and contracts
- Unauthorized calls are blocked with HTTP 403 and logged for audit
- Applies to all user calls, application traffic, explorer queries, and bridge operations
- Authenticate users using corporate IdPs (Azure AD, Okta, Ping) via OIDC/SAML tokens - (coming soon)

**Request Path:**
Client → Proxy RPC → Sequencer RPC

## Compliance & Audit Support

Regulated entities require visibility, traceability, and selective access. Prividium is designed with that in mind.

**Features:**

- A private block explorer shows only what each user is authorized to view (gated via Proxy)
- System logs from all core components are available for integration with enterprise logging and analytics tools
- Chain operators can export inclusion proofs or filtered ledger views on-demand
- Auditors can be granted scoped access without exposing unrelated user data

## Ethereum-Grade Finality

Every finalized Prividium batch is proven and posted to Ethereum using the ZKsync Gateway.

**Finalization Flow:**

1. The Prividium sequencer finalizes a batch of blocks
2. The prover generates a STARK proof for the batch and posts it on ZKsync Gateway
3. The relayer submits the state root and proof to Ethereum
4. Once verified on-chain, the batch becomes immutable (unless Ethereum reorganizes)

This ensures that every block is cryptographically verified and finalized on Ethereum, ensuring tamper-proof integrity and eliminating settlement risk.
All without revealing sensitive information

## Seamless Interoperability

ZKsync enables protocol-level interoperability across private and public chains, all anchored to Ethereum.
With shared settlement and ZK proofs, institutions can move assets securely and atomically between networks,
all without consortium agreements, third-party bridges, or compromises to customization.

Daily operations remain private, but interoperability is opt-in and cryptographically verified.
