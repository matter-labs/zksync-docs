This page outlines the recommended deployment model for running a ZKsync Prividium chain in production.
Components are grouped by trust boundary and network tier, following enterprise best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.

### DMZ / API Gateway Tier

**Components:**

- Proxy RPC
- Explorer front-end

**Hosting:**

- Deployed in a public subnet behind a secure edge load balancer

**Purpose:**

- Acts as the single ingress point for users and apps
- All JSON-RPC and Explorer requests pass through the Proxy, which enforces access control via policy files
- Explorer front-end communicates only with the Proxy, avoiding direct access to internal infrastructure

### Application Tier (Private Subnet)

**Components:**

- Sequencer
- Prover farm (CPU/GPU workers; auto-scalable)

**Hosting:**

- Deployed in private address space, inaccessible from the public Internet

**Purpose:**

- Runs all consensus-critical logic
- Sequencer requires fast access to the state database
- Provers consume large compute resources but require no inbound access

### Data Tier (Private Subnet)

**Components:**

- PostgreSQL (state DB)
- Optional: Blob or object store for off-chain data

**Hosting:**

- Self-hosted or managed service inside a dedicated subnet with no Internet exposure

**Purpose:**

- Stores the complete L2 state securely
- Must support encryption, snapshots, and backup policies
- Only Sequencer and Prover have DB access

## Security and Placement Rationale

- **Single ingress, early rejection:** All external requests hit the Proxy RPC in the DMZ.
Unauthorized requests are filtered before reaching internal systems.
- **Private consensus logic:** Sequencer and Prover run in a non-routable subnet. Only internal services can communicate with them.
- **Outbound-only proof posting:** The relayer submits proofs to ZKsync Gateway without opening any inbound ports.
- **Data-at-rest controls:** Databases and blob stores are isolated and regularly backed up to support compliance and disaster recovery.

## Running a ZKsync Prividium Chain

To run a local ZKsync Prividium chain, go through the [Run ZKsync Prividium Chain](/zk-stack/prividium/run-prividium-chain) page.
