title: Prividium™ License Model
description: Understand Prividium™ commercial licensing.
---

Prividium™ uses an open core licensing model. The [**ZK Stack is fully open source**](/zk-stack/license) and
provides all components required to run a standard ZKsync chain. Prividium™ adds closed-source enterprise modules that
enable private, permissioned deployments for institutional environments.

This page explains which components are open source, which components require a Prividium™ license,
how the license applies in different deployment models, how to obtain a license and what rights and restrictions apply.

## Open Source Components

The following components are available under open source licenses and are not part of the Prividium™ commercial license:

- ZK Stack protocol components
  - Sequencer
  - Node
  - Prover
  - Bridge and Portal
- Core execution and consensus logic
- SDKs, tooling and developer resources

These components allow anyone to deploy, modify and operate a ZKsync chain without a commercial agreement.

## Prividium Licensed Components

Prividium™ extends the ZK Stack with functionality for private, permissioned institutional environments. These modules are **closed source**
and require a commercial license.

### Components included in the Prividium license

- **Permissioning system**

    Provides role-based access control, event permissioning and transaction-scoped groups.

- **Proxy RPC**

    Identity-aware request filtering, authorization and policy enforcement at the RPC boundary.

- **Private block explorer**

    Permission-aware explorer with restricted visibility of events, transactions and state.

- **Operational tooling**

    Configuration interfaces, audit logs, monitoring and other components required for operating a private chain.

You cannot use, deploy, or redistribute these modules without a valid Prividium™ license.

Unlike other Prividium™ components, the [Prividium™ SDK](/zk-stack/prividium/sdk) is distributed under the MIT License.

## Obtaining a Prividium License

The Prividium™ license governs use of the closed-source enterprise modules. The process differs between non-production evaluation and production use.

### Non production use: sandbox, POCs and testnets

No license fees apply for sandbox, proof-of-concept, or testnet environments.

To run Prividium in these environments you must:

1. **Accept the Prividium license terms**

    Review and accept the license that governs use of the Prividium modules.

2. **Request access to downloadable images (for self-hosted setups)**

    If you want to self-host Prividium for sandbox, POC or testnet, contact [bizdev@matterlabs.dev](mailto:bizdev@matterlabs.dev)

    and request access to the downloadable images. Include a short description of your use case and environment.

After accepting the license terms and receiving access, you can deploy Prividium™ modules in non-production environments without license fees.

### Production use

Production and mainnet deployments require a commercial agreement.

The typical process is:

1. **Initial evaluation**

    Alignment on the intended production use case, deployment model and technical requirements.

    This often follows or builds on a sandbox, POC or testnet deployment.

2. **Commercial agreement**

    Execution of a contract that defines production usage rights, SLAs, support scope and pricing.

3. **Ongoing access and updates**

    Licensed customers receive access to production qualified images, compatibility updates, maintenance releases and support according to the agreement.

ZK Stack remains open source and usable in any environment without a Prividium™ agreement. Only Prividium™ modules require these steps.

## Deployment Models

### Self-hosted Prividium chain

Institutions deploy the ZK Stack and the Prividium modules in their own infrastructure.

- Sandbox, POC and testnet

  - No license fees
  - Acceptance of license terms is required
  - Access to images is provided after contacting [bizdev@matterlabs.dev](mailto:bizdev@matterlabs.dev)

- Production

  - Requires a commercial agreement for Prividium modules
  - Grants rights to run Prividium in production and receive support and updates

### Managed service

Matter Labs operates the chain on behalf of the institution.

- The managed service subscription includes the right to use Prividium modules in the managed environment
- The customer does not host or redistribute the software
- Commercial terms are defined in the managed service agreement

## License Restrictions

The Prividium license does **not** permit:

- Redistributing or hosting Prividium modules for third parties unless explicitly permitted under a separate commercial agreement
- Hosting Prividium modules for external use outside the agreed scope
- Modifying or creating derivative works of the closed-source components
- Using Prividium modules without accepting the license terms or, for production, without a commercial agreement

The open-source ZK Stack is unrestricted and governed by its permissive licenses.

## Summary

- [ZK Stack is open source](/zk-stack/license) and free to use.
- Prividium adds closed-source enterprise modules for private, permissioned chains.
- Sandbox, POC and testnet use has no license fees and requires only acceptance of license terms and requesting image access if self-hosted.
- Production use requires a commercial agreement.
- Redistribution or hosting of Prividium modules for third parties is prohibited unless covered by a separate commercial agreement.
