title: Manage Roles
description: Create and manage roles on your Prividium™ chain.
---

Roles define access levels for users in Prividium™.
Each role groups permissions that determine what contracts and functions users can call through the **Proxy**.
Administrators create and manage roles in the **Admin Dashboard**.

### 1. Open the Roles page

1. Go to the **Admin Dashboard** at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Select **Roles** from the sidebar.
3. You will see a list of existing roles and the number of users assigned to each.

### 2. Create a new role

1. Click **Add Role**.
2. Enter a **Role Name** (for example, `Trader`, `Auditor`, or `Admin`).
3. Optionally add a short **Description**.
4. Click **Save**.

The new role appears in the list and is available for assignment to users.

### 3. Edit or delete a role

- **To rename or update a role:**
  1. Select the role from the list.
  2. Modify the name or description.
  3. Click **Save**.

- **To delete a role:**
  1. Click the **Delete** icon next to the role name.
  2. Confirm the deletion.

> Note: A role cannot be deleted if it is still assigned to active users.
> Reassign or remove those users first.

### 4. Assign roles to users

1. Go to **Users** in the sidebar.
2. Select the user you want to update.
3. Under **Roles**, select one or more roles from the list.
4. Click **Save**.

Each user can hold multiple roles.
A user’s effective permissions are the combination of all permissions granted to their assigned roles.

### 5. Common role examples

| Role | Purpose | Typical Permissions |
|------|----------|--------------------|
| **Admin** | Full system management | Manage users, roles, permissions, and disclosure settings |
| **Trader** | Executes transactions | Write access to token contracts, trading functions |
| **Auditor** | Read-only observer | View contract data and public disclosures |
| **Operator** | System maintainer | Read/write access to operational contracts only |

> You can customize role names and scopes to fit your organization’s structure.

### 6. Best practices

- Keep **Admin** roles limited to a small, trusted group.
- Use descriptive names that match your organization’s workflow.
- Avoid overlapping permissions across unrelated roles to maintain clarity.
- Review roles periodically as your deployment evolves.

### Next Step

Continue to [Permissions](./permissions.md) to define which contracts and functions each role can access.
