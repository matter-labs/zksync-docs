## Configuring Selective Disclosure

Selective disclosure allows specific on-chain data to be made public without exposing the rest of the private network.
Administrators use this feature to share verifiable information such as **token supply**, **bytecode**, or other approved contract data,
while keeping internal transactions and state private.

### 1. Open the Selective Disclosure page

1. Go to the **Admin Dashboard** at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Select **Selective Disclosure** from the sidebar.
3. You will see a list of registered contracts and disclosure options for each.

### 2. Enable disclosure for a contract

1. Select a contract from the list or register a new one if it is not yet added.
2. Choose the disclosure types to enable:
   - **Bytecode disclosure** — exposes the deployed bytecode for verification.
   - **ERC-20 supply disclosure** — allows public queries for total and circulating supply.
3. Click **Save**.

Once enabled, the corresponding public endpoints become available through the **Permissions API**.

### 3. Manage ERC-20 lock addresses

For ERC-20 contracts, you can specify lock addresses that represent non-circulating balances (for example, treasury or reserve wallets).

1. Select the ERC-20 contract.
2. Under **Lock Addresses**, click **Add Address**.
3. Enter the address to exclude from circulating supply calculations.
4. Click **Save**.

These addresses are subtracted from the total supply when calculating circulating supply.

### 4. Verify public endpoints

After enabling disclosure, anyone can query the following unauthenticated endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `/api/public-check/bytecode?address=<contract>` | Returns the verified bytecode of a disclosed contract | `https://your-domain/api/public-check/bytecode?address=0x123...` |
| `/api/public-check/erc20?address=<contract>` | Returns total and circulating supply for disclosed ERC-20s | `https://your-domain/api/public-check/erc20?address=0x123...` |

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "totalSupply": { "value": "0x52B7D2DCF" },
  "decimals": 18,
  "lockedBalances": [
    { "address": "0xF00...", "balance": "0x1BC16D674EC80000" }
  ]
}
```

### 5. Testing selective disclosure

1. Open a browser or API client.
2. Query one of the public endpoints using a disclosed contract address.
3. Confirm that:
   - The response includes only the data you enabled.
   - Other non-disclosed contracts return **404 Not Found**.

If the endpoint does not return data, verify that disclosure is enabled in the **Admin Dashboard**.

### 6. Best practices

- Disclose only data that is required for transparency or auditability.
- Keep contract addresses for disclosure under strict admin control.
- Use **lock addresses** to accurately represent circulating supply.
- Review disclosure settings periodically as contract logic evolves.

### Summary

Selective disclosure provides a controlled way to share public-facing data from a private or permissioned Prividium network.
It allows external users to verify contract authenticity and supply metrics without compromising confidential state information.
