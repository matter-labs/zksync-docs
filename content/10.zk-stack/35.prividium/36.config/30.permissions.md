title: Manage Permissions
description: Create and manage permissions on your Prividium chain.
---

Permissions define what each role can do within your Prividium network.
They control which smart contract functions users can read, write, or call through the **Proxy**.
Administrators configure permissions in the **Admin Dashboard** under **Contract Permissions**.

---

### 1. Open the Permissions page

1. Go to the **Admin Dashboard** at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Select **Contract Permissions** from the sidebar.
3. You will see a list of all registered contracts and their function-level access rules.

### 2. Register a contract

Before you can assign permissions, register the smart contract that needs access control.

1. Click **Add Contract**.
2. Enter:
   - **Contract Address**
   - **Contract Name**
   - **Description** (optional)
   - **ABI JSON** (paste the full ABI or upload the file)
3. Click **Save**.

Once registered, the contract’s functions will be available for permission mapping.

### 3. Add a permission rule

1. In the **Contract Permissions** view, find the desired contract.
2. Click **Add Rule**.
3. Select:
   - **Function name** (from ABI)
   - **Access type**: `read` or `write`
   - **Rule type** (see table below)
   - **Roles** allowed to call this function
4. Click **Save**.

Each function can have its own rule.
If a function has no rule, access is **denied by default**.

### 4. Permission rule types

| Rule Type | Description | Example Use Case |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Public** | Allows anyone to call this function | Read-only views like `totalSupply()` |
| **Check Role** | Requires the caller to hold one of the listed roles | Only users with `Trader` role can call `transfer()` |
| **Restrict Argument** | Ensures a function argument matches the caller’s wallet address | User can only `withdraw(address)` to their own wallet |
| **Check Role And Restrict Argument** | Requires both a role and an argument match | `Trader` role can `transferFrom()` only for their own address |
| **Check Role Or Restrict Argument** | Requires either a role or an argument match | Either admins or self-calls permitted |

### 5. Edit or remove a permission rule

- **To update:** select the rule, modify its parameters, and click **Save**.
- **To delete:** click the **Delete** icon next to the rule and confirm.

> Tip: Keep function rules minimal and precise. Unused or redundant rules increase maintenance overhead.

### 6. Default access policy

By design, Prividium uses a **deny-by-default** model:
if a contract or function has no rule, the Proxy blocks all access to it.

This ensures that only explicitly authorized functions can be called, reducing risk of accidental exposure.

### 7. Testing permissions

After updating permissions:

1. Open the **User Dashboard**.
2. Log in as a user with a specific role.
3. Interact with the connected dApp or contract through the Proxy.
4. Verify that allowed functions succeed and restricted ones fail.

If the Proxy returns `403 Forbidden`, the user lacks permission for that function.

### 8. Example configuration

| Contract | Function | Access | Rule Type | Allowed Roles |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| Token | `transfer(address,uint256)` | Write | Check Role | Trader |
| Token | `approve(address,uint256)` | Write | Restrict Argument | Trader |
| Token | `balanceOf(address)` | Read | Restrict Argument | Trader, Auditor |
| Registry | `register(address,string)` | Write | Check Role | Admin |

### 9. Best practices

- Keep **public** rules to a minimum.
- Use **Restrict Argument** for address-sensitive functions.
- Review permissions regularly, especially after contract upgrades.
- Document your role-to-permission mapping for audits.

### Next Step

Continue to [Manage Users](./users.md) to add user accounts, link wallets, and assign roles to users.
