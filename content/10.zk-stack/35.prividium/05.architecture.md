title: Architecture Overview
description: Understand how ZKsync Prividium works under the hood.
---

ZKsync Prividium is built on a **permissioned Validium chain** enhanced with robust access control.
It runs a private instance of the ZKsync Chain, complete with its own sequencer and prover, inside an organization’s infrastructure or cloud.
All transaction data and state are stored off-chain in a secure database, preserving confidentiality by design.

A **Proxy RPC layer** acts as the system’s entry point. All interactions—whether from users, enterprise applications, block explorer queries,
or bridge transactions—must go through this proxy. It enforces fine-grained access policies,
ensuring that only authenticated and authorized requests reach the chain.
By separating the public interface from the internal blockchain components, ZKsync Prividium prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive data.

State updates are finalized on Ethereum via the **ZKsync Gateway**, which receives the ZKsync Prividium chain’s state roots and zero-knowledge proofs.
This anchors the chain’s state to Ethereum, providing L1-grade security and enabling interoperability with other chains in the ZKsync ecosystem.

This architecture delivers privacy and control at the L2 level while inheriting security from Ethereum,
making ZKsync Prividium well-suited for institutional use cases such as trading, payments, asset issuance, and compliance-sensitive workflows.

### Components

Adding privacy to a ZKsync chain is possible by making changes
to the RPC API and block explorer.
The ZKsync Stack CLI provides a production-ready implementation
of these changes for you, but they can be customized as needed.

- [Access Controls](/zk-stack/prividium/proxy#configuring-access): Fine-grained, role-based permissions ensure that only authorized personnel can
view or interact with your private chain.
- [Proxy RPC](/zk-stack/prividium/proxy) that filters requests based on the configured permissions. Authenticated JSON-RPC endpoints apply
your internal access policies to every request, maintaining full control over data access and interactions
- [Private Block Explorer](/zk-stack/prividium/explorer) with privacy protections enabled. This self-hosted interface gives authorized users
visibility into transactions, blocks, and state without exposing sensitive data to the public
- [Validium Chain](/zk-stack/running/validium): A dedicated ZKsync Chain deployed within your infrastructure.
It includes a built-in sequencer and prover to handle transaction processing and proof generation privately.
- [ZKsync Gateway](/zk-stack/zk-chains#gateway): Receives ZK proofs from your permissioned chain and publishes commitments to Ethereum.
This anchors integrity, ensures finality, and enables future interoperability.
