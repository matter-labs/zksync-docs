title: Architecture Overview
description: Understand how Prividium™ works under the hood.
---

Prividium™ is built on a **permissioned Validium chain** with integrated, role-based access control.
It runs a private instance of the ZKsync Chain, complete with its own sequencer and prover, inside an organization’s infrastructure or cloud.
All transaction data and state are stored off-chain in a secure database, ensuring privacy by design.

A **Proxy RPC layer** serves as the single entry point to the network.
All interactions — from users, enterprise applications, block explorers, or bridge operations — must pass through this proxy.
It enforces fine-grained access rules using the **Prividium™ Permissioning System**,
ensuring that only authenticated and authorized requests reach the chain.
By separating the public interface from internal blockchain components, Prividium™ prevents unauthorized access and safeguards sensitive data.

State updates are finalized on Ethereum through the **ZKsync Gateway**, which receives the chain’s state roots and zero-knowledge proofs.
This anchors the chain to Ethereum, providing L1-grade security and enabling interoperability with other ZKsync Chains.

This architecture delivers **privacy, compliance, and auditability** at the L2 level while inheriting the trust and finality of Ethereum,
making Prividium™ ideal for institutional use cases such as trading, settlement, asset issuance, and compliance-sensitive workflows.

### Components

Prividium™ extends the ZK Stack architecture with dedicated modules for privacy, governance, and access control.
These components work together to provide secure, verifiable, and customizable network operations.

- [**Permissioning System**](/zk-stack/prividium/permissions-overview):
  A built-in role-based framework that manages **users**, **roles**, **permissions**, and **selective disclosure** through the **Admin Dashboard**.
  Administrators define who can read or write to contracts and configure disclosure settings without modifying code or YAML files.

- [**Proxy RPC**](/zk-stack/prividium/proxy):
  The secure interface that filters every request based on the policies defined in the Permissioning System.
  It validates user tokens issued via Okta or crypto-native (SIWE) login and enforces role and argument-level restrictions before forwarding to the sequencer.

- [**Private Block Explorer**](/zk-stack/prividium/explorer):
  A self-hosted explorer with access restrictions aligned to user roles.
  It allows authorized participants to view transactions, blocks, and state data while protecting sensitive information from public exposure.

- [**ZKsync Chain**](/zk-stack/customizations/validium):
  A private ZKsync Chain deployed within your infrastructure.
  It includes a dedicated sequencer and prover that execute transactions and generate zero-knowledge proofs locally.

- [**ZKsync Gateway**](/zksync-protocol/gateway):
  Receives zero-knowledge proofs and publishes commitments to Ethereum.
  This ensures data integrity, anchors the private chain to Ethereum, and enables future cross-chain interoperability.

### How Access Control Works

1. Users authenticate via **OIDC systems** (e.g. Okta, Auth0) or **Sign-in With Ethereum (SIWE)** in the **User Dashboard**.
2. The **Proxy RPC** forwards their request and token to the **Permissions API**.
3. The **Permissions API** verifies the user’s identity, role, and function-level rules.
4. Authorized requests are sent to the **Sequencer RPC**, which executes transactions privately.
5. State updates are committed to Ethereum through the **ZKsync Gateway**.

This design ensures that access control, compliance, and selective disclosure are built directly into the network stack,
not managed through static configuration files.
