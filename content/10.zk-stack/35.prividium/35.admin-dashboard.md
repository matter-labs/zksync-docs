description: Overview of the Prividium™ Admin Dashboard configuration capabilities.

The Prividium™ Admin Dashboard provides a graphical interface for chain administrators to configure access controls, manage identities,
and set privacy parameters.
This guide outlines the core configuration areas available in the dashboard.

## Authentication

Authentication determines how users access the network. Prividium™ supports two primary methods:

* **OIDC / Enterprise SSO**: Integrates with identity providers like Okta or Auth0. This allows users to log in using their corporate credentials.
* **Sign-In With Ethereum (SIWE)**: Allows crypto-native users to authenticate directly with an Ethereum wallet.

Hybrid authentication is supported, enabling a single environment to accommodate both enterprise users and external wallet-based actors.

## User Management

The User Registry tracks all identities authorized to interact with the chain.

* **User Profiles**: Each user has a profile that can be linked to an OIDC subject (for SSO users) or created standalone.
* **Wallet Linking**: Multiple wallet addresses can be linked to a single user profile.
This associates on-chain activity from those addresses with the user's identity.
* **Role Assignment**: Roles are assigned at the user level and apply to all linked wallets.

## Roles & Permissions

Access control is enforced via a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model.

### 1. Roles
Roles are named collections of permissions (e.g., `Admin`, `Auditor`, `Operator`).
They serve as the primary mechanism for grouping users with similar access requirements.

### 2. Contract Registry
To configure permissions, contracts must first be registered in the dashboard.
This involves providing the contract address and its ABI (Application Binary Interface).
The ABI allows the system to recognize individual functions for granular permissioning.

### 3. Permission Rules
Permission rules are applied to specific functions within registered contracts.
If no rule is defined for a function, access is **denied by default**.

| Rule Type | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- |
| **All Users** | Allows any authenticated user to call the function. |
| **Check Role** | Restricts access to users holding a specific role. |
| **Restrict Argument** | Validates transaction arguments against the caller's address (e.g., ensuring a user can only `withdraw` to their own address). |
| **Check Role AND Restrict** | Requires the user to hold a role AND satisfy the argument restriction. |
| **Check Role OR Restrict** | Grants access if the user holds a role OR satisfies the argument restriction. |

## Selective Disclosure

Selective disclosure allows specific data points to be queried via public,
unauthenticated RPC endpoints (`prividium_*` methods), while keeping the rest of the chain state private.

* **Bytecode Disclosure**: Exposes the bytecode hash and Merkle proofs for deployed contracts, enabling source code verification.
* **Token Supply**: Exposes `totalSupply` and `decimals` for ERC-20 tokens.
  * **Lock Addresses**: Administrators can configure specific addresses (e.g., treasury, vesting) to be excluded from the circulating supply calculation.

## Application Ecosystem

The Admin Dashboard also manages external applications connecting to the chain.

* **OAuth Clients**: Administrators can register client applications (dApps, analytics tools) that require OAuth 2.0 access to the Permissions API.
* **CORS Settings**: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies for registered web applications.
