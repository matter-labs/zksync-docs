The Prividium™ SDK is not yet publicly available.
This documentation serves as a preview.
::

The Prividium™ SDK is a TypeScript SDK for integrating with Prividium™'s authorization system.
It provides a seamless authentication flow and secure RPC communication for applications running on a Prividium™, including:

- Popup-based OAuth Authentication
- JWT Token Management
- [Viem](https://viem.sh/) Integration

## Security Considerations

- **Token Storage:** Tokens are stored in local storage by default. Developers may consider custom storage for sensitive applications.
- **CSRF Protection:** The OAuth state parameter provides CSRF protection during authentication flow.
- **Token Expiration:** The SDK automatically validates token expiration and clears expired tokens.
- **Origin Validation:** Popup messages are validated against the configured auth origin.
