If at some point during development you wish to stop and restart your chain,
here are the complete steps for restarting.

To restart the chain and RPC APIs, go to the ecosystem folder and:

1. Run `zkstack containers` to restart the L1 and postgres Docker containers.
  If you have deleted the containers, go through the initial ecosystem setup steps again.
1. Run `zkstack server` to start the standard RPC API.
1. In a new terminal, start the proxy RPC API with `zkstack private-rpc run`.
1. In a new terminal, start the contract verifier with `zkstack contract-verifier run`.
1. In another terminal, start the explorer backend with `zkstack explorer backend`.
1. In another terminal, start the explorer frontend with `zkstack explorer run`.
