description: Learn about creating a Prividium chain with ZKsync.
---

Prividium is a private, enterprise-grade blockchain framework for secure, compliant onchain financial operations.
It runs within your infrastructure, preserving privacy and control while anchoring trust to Ethereum via zero-knowledge proofs.

Prividium is built for institutions that must keep
sensitive data private while still leveraging blockchain for critical processes.
It provides full control over data, satisfies regulatory requirements,
and inherits Ethereum’s security without revealing transaction details.

While privacy can be enabled with a custom implementation,
the ZK Stack CLI offers a streamlined path to spin up a private chain with Prividium.

## Composable Privacy

Prividium ensures that all transaction data remains inside your
environment. Only cryptographic proofs leave the system, guaranteeing integrity
and finality.
It lets chain operators choose which contracts and functions are public,
private, or authenticated.

The key features of Prividium include:

- Ability to make anything private
- Full data access for chain operators
- Easy editing of what’s private without redeploying contracts
- Final settlement on Ethereum
- Interoperability with other Prividium chains
- Full compatibility with existing Solidity contracts

### How does it work?

Privacy is enabled by restricting access on the sequencer/API level.
The ZK Stack provides an out-of-the-box option that implements access control.
The chain operator can define a configuration file,
detailing the contracts and functions that can be accessed.

To access the network, users request an access token,
which provides a scoped view of the network based on the operator's configuration.

The full explorer data and RPC is only available to the chain operators.
