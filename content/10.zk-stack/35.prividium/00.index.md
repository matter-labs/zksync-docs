Prividium lets institutions operate a **private**, permissioned blockchain within their own infrastructure or cloud,
while still **anchoring every transaction to Ethereum** for security and finality.

Sensitive data stays completely off the public chain, but each state update is verified on Ethereum using zero-knowledge proofs.

This design solves the core challenge in enterprise blockchain adoption:
**how to maintain privacy and control without giving up interoperability with the broader Ethereum ecosystem**.

### Key differentiators of Prividium

**Privacy with Control:** Transaction data remains off-chain (private), so internal information (e.g. trades, balances) stays confidential,
yet every block is verified via zk-proof on Ethereum.
Firms can selectively disclose data to regulators or auditors as needed without revealing everything to the public.

**Built-in Compliance:** The platform ships with role-based access controls, on-chain identity verification, and KYC/KYB/AML support baked in
Only permissioned, authenticated participants can interact with the chain, enabling enforcement of compliance policies from day one.

**Ethereum Anchoring & Interoperability:** Each batch of transactions is finalized on Ethereum (via a validity proof),
ensuring tamper-proof integrity and trustless settlement on Layer-1.
Assets and data can move across Ethereum or other ZKsync chains via native zk-based bridges without relying on third-party bridge protocols.

**Scalability & Performance:** As a Validium-based chain, Prividium offloads data storage off-chain,
allowing high throughput (thousands of TPS) with low latency and minimal L1 gas costs.
This makes it suitable for high-frequency enterprise use cases (trading, payments, etc.) without sacrificing security.

### What data is posted publicly

Only the state root hashes and ZK proofs are publicly posted.
No information about the transaction details can be derived from public onchain data.

The only other public information includes deposits and withdrawls
to or from rollup chains, as the information will be public on the rollup.
Deposits and withdrawls to or from other Prividium chains remain fully private,
only visible to the involved chain operators.

The full transaction data stays in the chain database,
fully visible only to the chain operators.

### How it works

Prividium enforces privacy by controlling access at the API layer.
Instead of making data publicly available, it uses a gated infrastructure built into the ZKsync Stack.

- **Access control** is defined by the chain operator using a configuration file that specifies which users or groups can call specific contracts and methods.
- **Users and Apps** connect through a Private RPC proxy, which checks each request against the configured access policies.
- **Access tokens** are issued to authenticated users, giving them a scoped view of the network—only what they’re allowed to see or interact with.
- **Full RPC and explorer access** is reserved for chain operators and internal systems.

Under the hood, the chain runs as a **Validium**, executing transactions privately and storing state off-chain (e.g., in a secure database).
Each batch of transactions produces a zero-knowledge proof and a new state root, which are submitted to Ethereum.
This anchors the private chain to Ethereum, ensuring security and finality without exposing sensitive data.
