description: Learn about creating a Prividium chain with ZKsync.
---

Prividium is a private, enterprise-grade blockchain framework for secure, compliant onchain financial operations.
It runs within your infrastructure, preserving privacy and control while anchoring trust to Ethereum via zero-knowledge proofs.

Prividium is built for institutions that must keep
sensitive data private while still leveraging blockchain for critical processes.
It provides full control over data, satisfies regulatory requirements,
and inherits Ethereum’s security without revealing transaction details.

While privacy can be enabled with a custom implementation,
the ZK Stack CLI offers a streamlined path to spin up a private chain with Prividium.

## Composable Privacy

Prividium ensures that all transaction data remains inside your
environment. Only cryptographic proofs leave the system, guaranteeing integrity
and finality.
It lets chain operators choose which contracts and functions are public,
private, or authenticated.

The key features of Prividium include:

- Ability to make anything private
- Full data access for chain operators
- Easy editing of what’s private without redeploying contracts
- Final settlement on Ethereum
- Interoperability with other Prividium chains
- Full compatibility with existing Solidity contracts

### How does it work?

Privacy is enabled by restricting access on the sequencer/API level.
The ZK Stack provides an out-of-the-box option that implements access control.
The chain operator can define a configuration file,
detailing the contracts and functions that can be accessed.

To access the network, users request an access token,
which provides a scoped view of the network based on the operator's configuration.

The full explorer data and RPC is only available to the chain operators.

### Components

Adding privacy to a ZK chain is possible by making changes
to the RPC API and block explorer.
The ZK Stack CLI provides a production-ready implementation
of these changes for you, but they can be customized as needed.

In addition to the standard components of a ZK chain,
the Prividium adds two additional components:

- A [Proxy RPC API](/zk-stack/prividium/proxy) that filters requests based on the configured permissions
- A [block explorer](/zk-stack/prividium/explorer) with privacy protections enabled

## What data is posted publicly?

Only the state root hashes and ZK proofs are publicly posted.
No information about the transaction details can be derived from public onchain data.

The only other public information includes deposits and withdrawls
to or from rollup chains, as the information will be public on the rollup.
Deposits and withdrawls to or from other Prividium chains remain fully private,
only visible to the involved chain operators.

The full transaction data stays in the chain database,
fully visible only to the chain operators.

## Running a Prividium Chain

To run a local Prividium chain, go through the [Run Prividium Chain](/zk-stack/prividium/run-prividium-chain) page.
