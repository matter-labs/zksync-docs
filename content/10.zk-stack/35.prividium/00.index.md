Prividium lets institutions operate a **private**, permissioned blockchain within their own infrastructure or cloud,
while still **anchoring every transaction to Ethereum** for security and finality.

Sensitive data stays entirely off the public chain, but each state update is verified on Ethereum using zero-knowledge proofs.

This design solves a core challenge in enterprise blockchain adoption:
**how to maintain privacy and control without giving up interoperability with the broader Ethereum ecosystem**.

### Key Differentiators of Prividium

**Privacy with Control:**
Transaction data remains offchain, so internal details such as trades and balances stay confidential.
Each block is verified on Ethereum using zero-knowledge proofs.
Chain operators can selectively disclose data to auditors or regulators without exposing the full ledger.

**Built-in Compliance:**
Role-based access controls, single sign-on integration, and support for KYC, KYB, and AML workflows are built in.
Only authenticated and authorized users can interact with the chain, enabling policy enforcement from day one.

**Ethereum Anchoring and Interoperability:**
Each batch of transactions is finalized on Ethereum using a validity proof, ensuring tamper-proof integrity and trustless settlement.
Assets and data can move between Ethereum and other public or private ZKsync Chains
using native zero-knowledge-based bridges without relying on external custodians.

**Scalability and Performance:**
As a Validium chain, Prividium stores state off-chain, enabling high throughput and low transaction costs.
It supports latency-sensitive use cases like trading and payments without compromising on security.

### What Data Is Public

Only the state root hashes and zero-knowledge proofs are posted to Ethereum.
No transaction inputs, addresses, or calldata are visible or inferable from public chain data.

The only additional public data appears when interacting with non-private chains, such as deposits or withdrawals to Ethereum or other rollups.
These interactions will be visible on the receiving chain.

All other transaction and state data remains inside the private chain database, accessible only to the operator.

### How It Works

Prividium enforces privacy and access control at the API layer, using infrastructure built into the ZKsync Stack.

- Access control is configured in a YAML file that defines which users or groups can call specific contracts and methods.
- Users and applications connect through a Private RPC proxy, which enforces access policies on every request.
- Authenticated users receive access tokens tied to their role, giving them a filtered view of the chain.
- Full RPC and explorer access is restricted to chain operators and internal systems.

The chain runs as a Validium. It executes transactions privately and stores state off-chain in a secure database.
Each batch of transactions produces a zero-knowledge proof and a new state root that are submitted to Ethereum.
This anchors the private chain to Ethereum, ensuring security and finality without exposing sensitive data.
