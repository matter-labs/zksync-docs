description: Learn about the Prividium™ Permissioning API and Selective Disclosure.

Prividium™ offers flexible and customizable ways for chain operators to have granular control over access to reading onchain data or calling contracts.
There are two systems used to manage this control: the [permissions API](#permissions-api), and [selective disclosure](#selective-disclosure).

## Permissions API

The permissions API is a layer between the standard RPC API and the Proxy RPC API that controls **who** can call certain functions in a contract.
It acts as a central hub for access control definitions and filtering rules.

All permissions require user authentication. The system supports both corporate identity providers (e.g. Okta) and crypto-native login flows.

Permissions are managed by chain administrators through the **Admin Dashboard**.
See [Admin Dashboard](/zk-stack/prividium/35.admin-dashboard) for details on managing users, roles, and rules via the UI.

### Authentication & Authorization Flow

1. **Request**: A user sends a transaction signed with their wallet and accompanied by a JWT.
1. **Verification**: The Proxy validates the JWT and ensures the wallet address is linked to that user session.
1. **Check**: The Proxy queried the Permissions API to see if the user has the required role (or meets specific argument restrictions) for the target function.
1. **Execution**: If authorized, the request is forwarded to the sequencer.

## Selective Disclosure

Selective disclosure is a privacy feature that allows chain operators to make specific pieces of information publicly accessible via the Proxy RPC API,
while maintaining the confidentiality of all other contract data.

### How It Works

Selective disclosure controls **what** data is publicly visible without authentication.

1. **Configuration**: Admins enable disclosure types for specific contracts in the [Admin Dashboard](/zk-stack/prividium/35.admin-dashboard).
1. **Request**: Any user can call a `prividium_*` RPC endpoint without an auth token.
1. **Authorization**: The Proxy checks the Permissions API to verify if disclosure is enabled for that contract.
1. **Retrieval**: If authorized, the Proxy returns the data (and cryptographic proofs) from the private chain.

### Disclosure Types

| Disclosure Type | Endpoint | Public Data Returned |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Contract Bytecode** | `prividium_bytecodeDisclosure` | `byteCodeHash`, `proof` (Merkle proof) |
| **Token Supply** | `prividium_tokenSupplyDisclosure` | `totalSupply`, `decimals`, `lockedBalances` |

#### Use Cases

* **Bytecode Disclosure**: Allows auditors and users to verify that a deployed contract matches its published source code,
critical for trust in a private environment.
* **Token Supply Disclosure**: Enables accurate "Circulating Supply" tracking for tokens listed on exchanges or aggregators (like CoinGecko)
without exposing individual holder balances.

### Example Response

When querying `prividium_tokenSupplyDisclosure`, the API returns standard JSON-RPC data that tools can easily consume:

```json
{
  "totalSupply": { "value": "0x52B7D2DCF" },
  "decimals": 18,
  "lockedBalances": [
    { "address": "0xF00...", "balance": "0x1BC16D674EC80000" }
  ]
}
```

### Best Practices

* **Minimize Disclosure**: Only disclose data strictly required for transparency or auditability.
* **Isolate Contracts**: Keep contracts intended for public disclosure separate from highly sensitive internal logic if possible.
* **Manage Lock Addresses**: Regularly update lock addresses (treasuries, vesting) to ensuring circulating supply metrics remain accurate.
