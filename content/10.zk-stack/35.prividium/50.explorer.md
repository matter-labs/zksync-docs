Like the RPC layer, the block explorer is split into to two versions with the ZKsync Prividium framework:
one public-facing and one internal.
The internal block explorer mirrors a standard block explorer for a public chain.
All transaction data can be accessed by the chain operators.

The public-facing block explorer uses the the proxy RPC API and permissioning system so that the configured access rules are applied.

## Setup options

When initializing the ZKsync Prividium explorer,
there are four options for configuration:

- The **explorer database url**
- The **explorer database name**
- The **session max age**, set in milliseconds, is the time a logged-in session lasts in the block explorer app.
  The default is one day.
- The [**session same site**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) value
  sets the configuration for when to send session credentials from the API.
  The value can be `none`, `strict` or `lax`.
  The default option is `strict`.

1. Run `zkstackup` to upgrade your version of `zkstack`.
1. Stop the explorer frontend.
