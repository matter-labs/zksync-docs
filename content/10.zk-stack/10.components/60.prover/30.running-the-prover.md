title: Running the Prover
---

Our ZK code is spread across three repositories:

[Boojum](%%zk_git_repo_era-boojum%%/tree/main) contains the low level ZK details.

[zkevm_circuits](%%zk_git_repo_era-zkevm_circuits%%/tree/main) contains the code for the circuits.

[zkevm_test_harness](%%zk_git_repo_era-zkevm_test_harness%%/tree/v1.4.0) contains the tests for the
circuits.

To get started, run the `basic_test` from the `era-zkevm_test_harness`:

```bash
rustup default nightly-2023-08-23
cargo update
cargo test basic_test  --release -- --nocapture

```

This test may take several minutes to run, but you will see lots of information along the way!
