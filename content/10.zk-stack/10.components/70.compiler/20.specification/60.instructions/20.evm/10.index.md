### EraVM Assembly

Assembly emitted for LLVM standard library functions depends on available optimizations which differ between versions. If there is no
assembly example under an instruction, compile a reproducing contract with the latest version of `zksolc`.

EraVM specification contains a list of [all EraVM instructions (see the table of contents)](https://matter-labs.github.io/eravm-spec/spec.html).
