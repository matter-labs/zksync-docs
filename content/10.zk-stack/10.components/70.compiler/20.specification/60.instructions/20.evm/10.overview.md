### zkSync VM Assembly

Assembly emitted for LLVM standard library functions depends on available optimizations which differ between versions. If there is no
assembly example under an instruction, compile a reproducing contract with the latest version of `zksolc`.

zkSync VM specification contains a list of [all zkSync VM instructions (see the table of contents)](%%zk_git_repo_eravm-spec%%/spec.html).
