title: PubSub JSON-RPC API
description: Methods to subscribe/unsubscribe to events and receive notifications on zkSync Era.
---

Clients can subscribe to specific events and receive notifications,
thus avoiding the need to poll. zkSync is fully compatible with [Geth's pubsub API](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/pubsub),
except for the `syncing` subscription.

The WebSocket URL is `wss://mainnet.era.zksync.io/ws`

## `eth_subscribe`

Creates a new subscription for events.

#### Parameters

1. **String** - Name of the subscription. Valid names include "newHeads" for new block headers, "logs" for new log entries,
and others depending on the client's capabilities.
1. **Object** - (Optional) Filter conditions for the subscription, applicable for subscriptions like "logs" where specific event criteria can be set.

#### Returns

**DATA** - A subscription ID used to identify and manage the subscription.

#### Example Request

```sh
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_subscribe",
  "params": ["newHeads"]
}
```

```
