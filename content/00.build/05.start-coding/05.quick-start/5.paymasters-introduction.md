title: Paymasters introduction
description: Learn about paymasters and use one to pay transaction fees with your own token
---

This tutorial makes use of smart contracts deployed in the previous two tutorials,
[Deploy your first contract](/build/start-coding/quick-start/deploy-your-first-contract) and [Create an ERC20 token](/build/start-coding/quick-start/erc20-token).
This section introduces one of the custom features
of ZKsync: native account abstraction and paymasters.

In this tutorial we will:

:check-icon Learn about paymasters.

:check-icon Review the testnet paymaster smart contract code.

:check-icon Use the testnet paymaster to pay transaction fees with our own ERC20 token.

## Prerequisites

1. Before you start, make sure that
[you’ve configured the %%zk_testnet_name%% in your browser wallet by following the instructions here](/build/connect-to-zksync).
1. In addition, fund your wallet with %%zk_testnet_name%% ETH using [one of the available faucets](/ecosystem/network-faucets).

## What is a Paymaster?

Paymasters in the ZKsync ecosystem represent a groundbreaking approach to handling transaction fees.
They are special accounts designed to subsidize transaction costs for other accounts,
potentially making certain transactions free for end-users.
This feature is particularly useful for dApp developers looking
to improve their platform's accessibility and user experience by covering transaction fees on behalf of their users.

Every paymaster has the following two functions:

- `validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction` : this function uses the transaction parameters (fields like `from`, `amount` , `to`
  ) to execute the required validations and pay for the transaction fee.

- `postTransaction`: this optional function runs after the transaction is executed.

## Paymaster smart contract code

Although application developers are encouraged to create their own paymaster smart contract, ZKsync provides a testnet
paymaster for convenience and testing purposes.

The paymaster smart contract code is provided "as-is" without any express or implied warranties.
<br />

- Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their design, implementation,
  and use of the paymaster smart contract software complies with all applicable laws,
  including but not limited to money transmission, anti-money laundering (AML), and payment processing regulations.

- The developers and publishers of this software disclaim any liability for any legal issues that may arise from its use.

In the `validateAndPayForPaymasterTransaction` it is:

1. Checking that the paymasterInput is `approvalBased`.
2. Checking that the allowance of a given ERC20 is enough.
3. Transferring the transaction fee (`requiredETH`) in ERC20 from the user’s balance to the paymaster.
4. Transferring the transaction fee in ETH from the paymaster contract to the bootloader.

## How to send a transaction through a paymaster?

In order to send a transaction through a paymaster, the transaction must include the following additional parameters:

- `paymasterAddress`: the smart contract address of the paymaster
- `type`: should be `General` or `ApprovalBased` (to pay fees with ERC20 tokens)
- `minimalAllowance`: the amount of ERC20 tokens to be approved for spending (for `approvalBased` type paymasters only).
- `innerInput`: any payload we want to send to the paymaster (optional).

We’ll see an example next.

## Interacting with the testnet paymaster

We’re going to interact with the `ZeekMessages.sol` contract that we created in the first tutorial and use the
ERC20 token that we deployed in the second tutorial to pay the transaction fees.

## Takeaways

- Paymasters on ZKsync allow any account to pay fees with ERC20 tokens or enable gasless transactions.

- Paymasters are smart contracts that can have any validations and rules.
- To send a transaction through a paymaster, we only need to include additional parameters in the transaction.
