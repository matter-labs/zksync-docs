title: Create an ERC20 token
description: In this tutorial you'll build and deploy an ERC20 token to %%zk_testnet_name%%
---

This tutorial shows you how to deploy and interact with an ERC20 token on %%zk_testnet_name%%.

This is what you're going to do:

:check-icon Build an ERC20 token smart contract with additional custom logic

:check-icon Deploy the smart contract to the %%zk_testnet_name%% using Remix or Atlas.

## Prerequisites

1. Before you start, make sure that
[you’ve configured the %%zk_testnet_name%% in your wallet](/build/connect-to-zksync).
2. Have at least 0.5 %%zk_testnet_name%% ETH. If you need more, use [one of the faucets](/ecosystem/network-faucets).

To complete this tutorial you'll use either Atlas or Remix. Select your preferred tool:

## Takeaways

- **ZKsync Era is EVM compatible** and supports existing smart contract libraries like OpenZeppelin
- **Use popular libraries like** `ethers` , `viem`, or `web3.js` to interact with smart contracts deployed on ZKsync Era.

The ERC20 token code is provided “as is” without any express or implied warranties.

- The regulatory regime governing digital assets is still developing and is unclear in many jurisdictions.

- ERC20 tokens may possess unique legal, tax, and market risks, so it is up to you to determine which, if any, laws apply to your deployment of ERC20 tokens.

- The developers and publishers of this software disclaim any liability for any legal issues that may arise from its use.
