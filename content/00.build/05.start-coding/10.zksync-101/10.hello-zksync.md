Welcome to the ZKsync 101 guide for deploying smart contracts on ZKsync! In this series, we'll walk you through the process
of creating and deploying a simple smart contract that creates a crowdfunding campaign for Zeek. In this section you will learn the following:

:check-icon Initialize a new project with zksync-cli.

:check-icon Craft a smart contract to fund Zeek's latest adventure.

:check-icon Deploy the contract on the ZKsync Era using your choice of Hardhat or Foundry.

Let's dive in and start your developer journey on ZKsync!

## Prerequisites

This series requires some initial setup of tools to elevate your
development experience building for ZKsync.
Make sure to go through the setup provided in the initial [Getting started](/build/start-coding/zksync-101) section.

If you have not started up a local node yet from the Getting started page, see
[Set up your local node](/build/start-coding/zksync-101#setup-local-node) in Getting started.

Select the following framework you want to get started using ZKsync Era with.

## Takeaways

- **EVM Compatibility:** ZKsync is EVM compatible and you can write smart contracts in Solidity or Vyper.
- **Custom Compilation:** Contracts deployed to ZKsync are compiled using `zksolc` or `zkvyper` as
they generate a special bytecode for ZKsync's ZKEVM.
- **Development Tools:** ZKsync supports your favorite development toolkit Hardhat and Foundry.

## Next steps

Having successfully deployed your first contract on ZKsync, you're well on your way to becoming
a proficient ZKsync developer. To expand your expertise:

- **Explore Contract Factories:** Enhance your project by building a contract factory
for the `CrowdfundingCampaign` contract in the [next guide](/build/start-coding/zksync-101/contract-factory).
This will allow you to efficiently manage multiple crowdfunding campaigns, each with its own unique parameters.
- **Dive Deeper into ZKsync Features:** Investigate advanced ZKsync features such as account abstraction,
and paymasters.
- **Join the Community:** Engage with the ZKsync developer community through forums,
Discord channels, Dev Discussions, or GitHub repositories. Share your experiences, ask questions,
and collaborate on projects.
