## Compile the CrowdfundingCampaign.sol contract

This guide introduces a crowdfunding campaign contract aimed at supporting Zeek's inventive ventures.
Let's start by reviewing the starter contract in the [`contracts/` directory](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-contract-templates/blob/main/templates/quickstart/hardhat/hello-zksync/contracts/Crowdfund.sol).

    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    contract CrowdfundingCampaign {
        address public owner;
        uint256 public fundingGoal;
        uint256 public totalFundsRaised;
        mapping(address => uint256) public contributions;

        event ContributionReceived(address contributor, uint256 amount);
        event GoalReached(uint256 totalFundsRaised);

        constructor(uint256 _fundingGoal) {
            owner = msg.sender;
            fundingGoal = _fundingGoal;
        }

        function contribute() public payable {
            require(msg.value > 0, "Contribution must be greater than 0");
            contributions[msg.sender] += msg.value;
            totalFundsRaised += msg.value;

            emit ContributionReceived(msg.sender, msg.value);

            if (totalFundsRaised >= fundingGoal) {
                emit GoalReached(totalFundsRaised);
            }
        }

        function withdrawFunds() public {
            require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can withdraw funds");
            require(totalFundsRaised >= fundingGoal, "Funding goal not reached");

            uint256 amount = address(this).balance;
            totalFundsRaised = 0;

            (bool success, ) = payable(owner).call{value: amount}("");
            require(success, "Transfer failed.");
        }

        function getTotalFundsRaised() public view returns (uint256) {
            return totalFundsRaised;
        }

        function getFundingGoal() public view returns (uint256) {
            return fundingGoal;
        }
    }
    ```

The `CrowdfundingCampaign` contract is designed for project crowdfunding.
This contract features:

- A constructor to initialize the campaign's funding target.
- The `contribute` method to log funds, triggering `ContributionReceived` and `GoalReached` events.
- The `withdrawFunds` method, allowing the owner to collect accumulated funds post-goal achievement.

Upon successful compilation, you'll receive output detailing the
`zksolc` and `solc` versions used during compiling and the number
of Solidity files compiled.

```bash
Compiling contracts for ZKsync Era with zksolc v1.4.1 and solc v0.8.17
Compiling 15 Solidity files
Successfully compiled 15 Solidity files
```

The compiled artifacts will be located in the `/artifacts-zk` folder.

## Deploy the contract

The deployment script is located at [`/deploy/deploy.ts`](https://github.com/matter-labs/zksync-contract-templates/blob/main/templates/quickstart/hardhat/hello-zksync/deploy/deploy.ts).

```typescript [deploy.ts]
import { deployContract } from "./utils";

// An example of a basic deploy script
// It will deploy a CrowdfundingCampaign contract to selected network
// `parseEther` converts ether to wei, and `.toString()` ensures serialization compatibility.
export default async function () {
  const contractArtifactName = "CrowdfundingCampaign";
  const constructorArguments = [ethers.parseEther('.02').toString()];
  await deployContract(contractArtifactName, constructorArguments);
}
```

**Key Components:**

- **contractArtifactName:** Identifies the `CrowdfundingCampaign` contract for deployment.
- **constructorArguments:** Sets initialization parameters for the contract. In this case,
the fundraising goal, converted from ether to `wei` to match Solidity's `uint256` type.

1. Execute the deployment command corresponding to your package manager. The default command
deploys to the configured network in your Hardhat setup. For local deployment, append
`--network inMemoryNode` to deploy to the local in-memory node running.

::code-group

```bash [npm]
npx hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts
# The deploy keyword will trigger the `deploy` script command on `package.json`
# To deploy the contract on local in-memory node:
# npx hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts --network inMemoryNode
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts
# The deploy keyword will trigger the `deploy` script command on `package.json`
# To deploy the contract on local in-memory node:
# yarn hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts --network inMemoryNode
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm exec hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts
# The deploy keyword will trigger the `deploy` script command on `package.json`
# To deploy the contract on local in-memory node:
# pnpm exec hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts --network inMemoryNode
```

```bash [bun]
bun run hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts
# The deploy keyword will trigger the `deploy` script command on `package.json`
# To deploy the contract on local in-memory node:
# bun run hardhat deploy-zksync --script deploy.ts --network inMemoryNode
```

Upon successful deployment, you'll receive output detailing the deployment process,
including the contract address, source, and encoded constructor arguments:

```bash
