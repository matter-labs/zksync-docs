## Environments

**Production**: Visit [zkSync Docs](https://docs.zksync.io/) for official documentation.

**Staging**: Test and preview changes on the
[zkSync Docs Staging](https://zksync-docs-staging-5eb09.web.app/) environment.

## Git workflow

- The `main` branch reflects the current production state.
- The `staging` branch is for previews in the staging environment.
- Contributors submit feature branches as PRs to the `staging` branch.

## Contribution workflow

To set up and run the project locally, consult the root [`README.md`](%%zk_git_repo_zksync-docs%%) file.

### Tracking work

Start your work by creating an [issue](%%zk_git_repo_zksync-docs%%/issues)
in the repo to prevent overlap and keep track of contributions.
Use the `[DOC]` tag for content edits or `[BUG]` for fixes.
Connect your PR to the created issue following the [GitHub guide on linking](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

Submit your PR against the `staging` branch.

## What the project uses

zkSync docs is built with Vue and Nuxt framework, utilizing Nuxt Modules for content development.
Familiarize yourself with Nuxt and review documentation for primary plugins.

### Nuxt

Nuxt is a Vue framework for building applications.
Visit the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction)
for an introduction to its structure and development process.

Creating new landing pages involves adding a new component in the `/pages` directory,
though most documentation work will focus on using Nuxt Content.

#### Debugging with Nuxt

Use Nuxt's [DevTools](https://devtools.nuxt.com/) for debugging.
A button with the Nuxt icon :u-icon{name="i-simple-icons-nuxtdotjs"}
appears at the bottom center of the viewport when running locally, opening a helpful panel.

### Nuxt Content

Nuxt Content allows building with markdown files in a `/content` folder.
It supports [Common Markdown with additional features](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/markdown).

A VSCode extension is recommended for proper syntax highlighting and is
included in the workspace list of recommended plugins to install.

Navigation of markdown files is automatically generated according to a [naming scheme](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/content-directory)
that uses numbering to order pages. We use a double digit numbering scheme.

#### Using Vue Components in MDC

Vue components can be used within markdown files, identified with `::`.
For custom Vue components in documentation, place them in `/components/content`.
Components in this directory are automatically imported for use in markdown content.
Refer to the [Vue components section](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/markdown#vue-components)
to learn how the Vue markdown syntax works.

Vue components that are not within the `/components/content` directory
need to be globally configured to use in markdown content.

### Nuxt UI

[Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/components/), used for styling and layout, includes
[Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/components/aside) features for development.

For using Nuxt UI components within MDC, configure them in `nuxt.config.ts` in the `'components:extend'` property under `hooks`.

Local development messages regarding `NUXT_UI_PRO_LICENSE` can be ignored, it will not affect local development and testing.

### Styling

Styling relies on Nuxt UI and Tailwind.
Configure styling through `app.config.ts` under `ui` or modify Tailwind settings in `tailwind.config.ts`.
Adhere to Tailwind's [Utility-First Fundamentals](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first),
avoiding custom styles in components with the use of the `@apply` feature.
