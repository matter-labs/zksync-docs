title: Documentation Styleguide
description: A comprehensive guide on zkSync documentation standards, including writing style, Markdown conventions, code snippets, and documentation categorization.
---

This guide outlines the standards for creating zkSync documentation,
ensuring consistency in writing style, Markdown conventions, and code snippets.

## Writing Style

For readability across a diverse audience, including non-native English speakers, we adhere to industry best practices from:

- [Google Developer Documentation Styleguide](https://developers.google.com/style)
- [Microsoft Writing Styleguide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)

It's crucial to create content that is inclusive, diverse, and timeless. Focus on:

- [Inclusive documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation)
- [Timeless documentation](https://developers.google.com/style/timeless-documentation)
- [Bias-free communication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/bias-free-communication)
- [Global communications](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/global-communications/)

## Spelling

Content in zkSync Docs are run through a linter for markdown formatting and spellchecking.
Some words may not pass the spellcheck linter and will need to be added to the dictionary list.
New words can be added to lists in `/cspell-config`. All words added to the dictionary are checked
for spelling only.

## Time & Dates

To minimize confusion due to global date format variations, adhere to the following in zkSync docs:

- Start calendars on Mondays.
- Use the date format `month dd, yyyy`, avoiding numerals for months (e.g., January 5, 2018).

## Kinds of zkSync Documentation

Following the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework, zkSync Docs categorizes content into

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step instructions to teach general skills (e.g., Deploying your first contract on zkSync Era).
- **Guides**: Task completion instructions for readers with basic knowledge (e.g., Debugging with zksync-cli).
- **References**: Detailed technical descriptions (e.g., Ethereum JSON-RPC API).
- **Explanation**: Content to deepen subject understanding
(e.g., Differences between zkSync Native Account Abstraction and Ethereum's EIP 4337).

### Choosing a category for writing

Leverage the [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) system when crafting a new article for zkSync Docs.
Writing without a clear category often results in unfocused content.
A well-defined focus keeps the content streamlined and clarifies the takeaway for the reader.

While adhering to this system, it may become evident that a single article
cannot encompass all aspects you wish to convey.
Feel encouraged to create multiple articles across different categories to comprehensively address your topic.

## Markdown and Vue

zkSync Docs combine Markdown with Vue components, available under `/components/content`.
Use Vue components in Markdown using `::` syntax and yaml frontmatter for props.
If the Vue component is an inline slot-less component, use the `{prop="val"}` format.

Learn more about using Markdown and Vue components with Nuxt Content's page on [Markdown](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/markdown).

### Content Switcher component

For content organization into tabs, utilize the `ContentSwitcher` component.
Apply the `items` prop to distribute content across tabs.
Organize these partials in a folder that matches the parent markdown file’s name,
preceded by an underscore.

Use the Content Switcher component in a situation where you have more than one
option to display for a subject depending on the reader's choices. For example,
use the Content Switcher component for a tutorial that provides a Remix and
Atlas option.

```md
::content-switcher
---
items: [{
  label: 'HardHat',
  partial: '_getting-started/_aPartial'
}, {
  label: 'Forge',
  partial: '_getting-started/_anotherpartial'
}]
---
::
```

### Display Partial Component

The Display Partial component lets you use the same piece of markdown content in different places.
Keep highly reusable pieces in the `/content/_partials` directory and reference the partial by its path.

Be careful when picking what content to share this way.
Make sure that the content can make sense on its own, no matter where it's used.
The page the partial is placed in should not affect the understanding of the partial, and
same the other way.

```md
:display-partial{path="_partials/setting-up-your-wallet"}
```

## Callouts

Callouts present warnings, extra detail, or references to related topics.
A callout should not contain anything essential to understanding the main content.

#### Example
::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
This is a `callout` with full **markdown** support. It can be used to link to [another page](/build/zksync-101).
::

#### Code

```md
::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
This is a `callout` with full **markdown** support. It can be used to link to [another page](/build/zksync-101).
::
```

## Code Samples

Use code samples where it helps to explain technical concepts. Create concise examples that are easy to read and understand,
avoid pasting an entire file of code.
Use the `ProseCode` component to display code.
Always define the language the code is represented in next to the backticks.
Additionally, you can define the name of the file to display as a header on the block.

#### Example

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: ['@nuxt/ui-pro'],
  modules: ['@nuxt/ui']
})
```

#### Code

```ts
    ```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      extends: ['@nuxt/ui-pro'],
      modules: ['@nuxt/ui']
    })
    ```
```

## Images

Add images to the `public/images/` directory to use in zkSync docs.
Use the markdown format to display images.

```md
![Image Alt Text](/images/example-image.png)
```

- Keep your image size to 600-960px wide.
- If you are displaying visual diagrams with text, use svg format for best clarity.
- Avoid using images to display only text, code or data output, use actual text.
- Every image should have a descriptive alt text.
- Optimize your image using a service like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/).

## Icons

Utilize Nuxt UI icons with the `UIcon` component, following the naming pattern `i-{collection_name}-{icon_name}`.
The Icon Collections that can be used are configured in `nuxt.config.ts`
in the `ui.icons.collections` property.

```md
:u-icon{name="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
```

## Links

Internal links are generated by the `/content` directory structure and the name of the markdown file.
For example, the file `/content/1.quick-start/2.deploy-contract.md` is defined as the path `/quick-start/deploy-contract`.

Link to internal pages using markdown format.

```md
[Getting Started](/build/zksync-101)
```

### Anchor Tags

Every header has an anchor link that you can link to.
Link to the page the anchor point is located in and add
the name of the anchor tag separated by dashes.

```md
[Getting Started](/build/zksync-101)
```

## Localization

Currently, zkSync Docs does not offer localized documentation.
Updates to this section will be provided as localization features become available.

## Use of AI

While fully AI-generated content is not accepted for zkSync Docs,
the assistance of AI tools like ChatGPT in editing content is permitted.
These tools can enhance the editing process,
although they may occasionally produce inaccurate information.
Always carefully review any AI-assisted content before finalizing.

You can use the following as a prompt for an AI tool to help with editing:

```text
The content is written in common markdown format.
Use the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide and the Microsoft Style Guide, emphasizing Bias-free communication.
Write in an active voice.
Do not use the definite or indefinite article with “zkSync Era”.
Assume the reader may be an international person whose first language might not be English.
Don’t use overly complex words unless the technical description is lost if changed.
Ensure all communication is bias-free, following the Microsoft Style Guide's directives for inclusiveness and fairness in language.
If the article I submit has a Header1 at the beginning, move that into a yaml frontmatter for the 'title' property.
Include a short description of the article in the yaml frontmatter in the 'description' property.
```

If your content includes technical descriptions and code examples, you can add the following to your prompt
to assist with formatting.

```text
Always use the word “function” and never the word “method” when referring to Solidity code.
Always use the word “function” for functions in JavaScript and TypeScript.
Always use the word “method” for attributes of an object in JavaScript and TypeScript.
When talking about Rust, always use the word “function” for functions defined on a type, and the word “method” for functions defined on an instance of a type.
When referring to a JSON RPC URL method, always use the word “method”.
```
