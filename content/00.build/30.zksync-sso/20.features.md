## Passkey Authentication

Passkeys are a core feature supported by ZKsync SSO that enable secure,
passwordless authentication for users interacting with applications on the ZK Chain.
Stored on users' devices, these passkeys make for a self-custodial and secure solution to private key management.
This standard also supports biometric authentication methods like Face ID and fingerprint recognition,
 utilizing the secp256r1 elliptic curve via native precompile in ZKsync.

## Sessions

A session is a temporary key that grants limited permissions to an account,
governed by a configurable policy set by the developer based on the needs of their application.
These sessions require explicit approval from the account owners and can be revoked or removed at any time after creation.
A session key holder can execute a restricted set of transactions from the account without needing the account owner’s signature for each action.

When an application requests a session, it specifies the desired policies that limit what that session key can do, which the account owner can approve.
This ensures that even if the session key is compromised, the potential loss is capped.

## Account Recovery

<!-- There are several methods available to users to recover their account: -->

**Multiple Devices with Passkey Synchronization**

Users can synchronize their passkeys across multiple devices using services like iCloud Keychain for Apple devices or similar services on other platforms.
This means if one device is lost, the passkeys are still accessible on other synchronized devices.

*More account recovery options are coming soon*

<!--
**Adding another auth page — *coming soon**?*
To avoid the reliance on a single trusted domain,
users can create or connect to a ZKsync SSO auth page hosted on a different domain!
By providing their account address, the alternate page can provide a great back-up location for passkeys.
These passkeys could be stored via FIDO device or a different online passkey provider than the primary key.

**Adding another passkey — *coming soon***

Users can register a new device by adding a new passkey to their account.
This typically involves verifying their identity on the new device, after which the new passkey is securely associated with their account.

**Recovery via Externally Owned Account (EOA) — *coming soon***

Users will soon be able to link an EOA to their ZKsync SSO.
If passkeys are lost, they can recover access by authenticating with their EOA, providing an additional layer of security and recovery option.

**Recovery via OAuth 2.0 — *coming soon***

OAuth Recovery ERC-7579 module enables users to set up an account recovery through OAuth tokens associated with their existing Web2 logins like
Gmail, Facebook, or X (formerly Twitter). This allows users to regain access by logging in with their familiar social media or email accounts.

## User Dashboard

ZKsync SSO provides a dashboard where users can conveniently manage their accounts through a web interface. This dashboard offers several key features:

- View their asset balances across all the ZK Chains.
- Add or remove passkeys or devices.
- Configure account recovery options.
- View all active sessions connected to their account and terminate unwanted sessions.
- View their transaction history.

## Modular

Developers can enhance the functionality of ZKsync SSO accounts by implementing compatible modules via smart contracts.
The module interface is based on [ERC-7579](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7579#modules)
to allow maximum flexibility while using ZKsync's powerful native account abstraction to developer overhead.

The existing passkey and session features are already implemented as modules,
and installed by default for every new account deployment.
Modules can be added or removed from the account, without having to migrate or upgrade the whole account!
