title: Interfaces
description: Get familiar with ZKsync SSO interfaces
---

This document will explicitly list each interface method supported by the super-set account and module, along with brief descriptions of each method.
It is important to clarify the distinction between the module interface and the account interface:
the module interface specifies the methods that external contracts need to implement,
whereas the account interface defines the methods that the smart account must support.

## ZKsync SSO specific functions

- `validateTransaction` - accepts a signature and the full transaction to execute, including paymaster information.
- `executeTransaction` - invoked by ZKsync's entry point to run a verified transaction
- `payForTransaction` and `prepareForPaymaster` - paymaster parsing functions called by the entry point to handle transaction fees and paymaster data.

## Account functions from 7579

- `executeFromExecutor` - a special entry point for modules that have been granted permission to execute within the smart account.
- `accountId` - returns a unique identifier for the contract type
- `supportsExecutionMode` - checks if a specific type of call data format is supported via entry points
- `supportModule` - verifies if a module type (1-4) is available on the account
- `installModule` - adds a module to the account
- `uninstallModule` - removes a module from the account
- `isModuleInstalled` - checks if a module is installed on the account

## Hooks

- `preCheck` - called before the execution flow begins
- `postCheck` - called after the execution flow completes

## Sessions

Each allowed `(address, selector)` pair will have an assigned `FunctionPolicy` with all the applied constraints.
`FunctionPolicy` will have a list of constraints on its arguments, as well as optional cumulative limits and allowances.

```solidity
// signer => session
mapping(address => SessionPolicy) sessions;

struct SessionPolicy {
    // (target, selector) => function policy
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes4 => FunctionPolicy)) policy;
    // timestamp when this session expires
    uint256 expiry;
    // to close the session early, flip this flag
    bool isOpen;
}

struct FunctionPolicy {
    // this flag is needed, as otherwise, an empty FunctionPolicy (default mapping entry)
    // would mean no constraints
    bool isAllowed;
    uint256 maxValuePerUse;
    LimitUsage valueUsage;
    Constraint[] paramConstraints;
}

struct Constraint {
    Condition condition;
    uint64 offset;
    bytes32 refValue;
    // Lifetime cumulative limit (optional)
    LimitUsage usage;
    // Cumulative limit per time period (optional)
    Allowance allowance;
}

struct LimitUsage {
    bool isLimited;
    uint256 limit;
    uint256 used;
}

struct Allowance {
    bool isLimited;
    uint256 timePeriod;
    uint256 limit;
    // period => used that period
    mapping(uint256 => uint256) used;
}

enum Condition {
    EQUAL,
    GREATER_THAN,
    LESS_THAN,
    GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
    LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
    NOT_EQUAL,
    NOT_CONSTRAINED
}
```

This Design was inspired by [Smart Sessions](https://github.com/erc7579/smartsessions/blob/main/contracts/external/policies/UniActionPolicy.sol)

## 4337 Module flow specific functions

- `validateUserOp` - performs validation of a user operation as defined in ERC-4337
- `executeUserOp` - called by the ERC-4337 account entry point after validations are successful to execute the user operation

## ZKsync Module flow specific functions

- `validateTransaction` - utilizes the same format as the account's validateTransaction function <br>
**Note:** Introducing a new function name here is intentional to prevent errors that could arise from overloading the existing
'PackedUserOp' struct with new optional fields.
This separation ensures clear delegation to internal validation mechanisms. <br>
**Compatibility:** By using the same types as ERC-1271, we enhance compatibility and tooling support.
Adopting the same function name for the selector may further improve interoperability.
