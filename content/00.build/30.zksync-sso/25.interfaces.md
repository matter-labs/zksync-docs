description: Get familiar with ZKsync SSO interfaces

While the internal functionality can be quite complex, the external interfaces for developers are very simple.
This provides some technical information on how these components can be used.

### Auth Server

The entrypoint to the SDK is via the ``zksyncAccountConnector`` to connect to the *Auth Server*.
This takes the auth domain, session, and basic app information (name, icon). The fully expanded type looks like:

```ts
type ZKsyncAccountConnectorOptions = {
  metadata?: {
    name: string,
    icon?: string,
  },
  session?: {
    expiresAt?: Date| bigint;
    feeLimit?: bigint | ({ limit: bigint; period?: bigint; });
    callPolicies?: ({
        target: Address;
        function?: string | AbiFunction;
        selector?: Hash; // if function is not provided
        maxValuePerUse?: bigint;
        valueLimit?: bigint | Limit;
        constraints?: {
            index: number | bigint;
            condition?: Condition | keyof typeof Condition;
            refValue?: Hash;
            limit?: Limit;
        },
    })[];
    transferPolicies?: (
        target: Address;
        maxValuePerUse?: bigint;
        valueLimit?: bigint | Limit;)[];
  },
  authServerUrl?: string;
};
```

This returns a [WAGMI connector](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/connectors) that can be used to perform wallet-like
actions with the available account.
All of the functionality is then exposed via WAGMI,
making the ZKsync SSO account nearly indistinguishable from any other standard wallet provider!

## Sessions

Sessions' combination of function selector and multiple layers of limits makes them effective security measures against unexpected behavior,
but they must be configured correctly in order to be most specific to the expected use cases.
The session interface is also included with the account and passkey creation interfaces so sessions can be created
during any important user interactions.

### Limit types

Limits are tracked either for a lifetime or a specific period on-chain.
Not all sessions or constraints are required to have limits, but it's the only way to prevent mis-use.
The limit amount provided is always an upper limit, where exceeding it for the value in question
 causes the limit to invalidate the transaction.
The value being limited depends on the limit's use,
the two places where limits are applied are for transfer value policies,
which limit the amount in the *value* of the transaction directly.
The other limit is the dynamic constraint,
where the value is specified via a byte offset from the start of the transaction data.

*(Limit period validation is currently WORK-IN-PROGRESS,
period limits are currently skipped entirely)*
A single lifetime limit per value isn't expressive enough to support great use cases like subscriptions,
so the limits also support the ability to reset the limit on a fixed period basis.
If provided as part of the limit,
the block.timestamp divisor for the limit to be enforced
(eg: 60 for a minute, 86400 for a day, 604800 for a week, unset for lifetime).

```ts
type Limit = {
  limit: bigint;
  period?: bigint;
};
```

### Transfer Policy

This is the simplest policy because there's the least amount of data to constrain.
They are applied at the contract (address) level,
so they can be great for preventing transfers with specific contracts or EOAs.
They are only applied when the transaction data is less than 4 bytes and only look at the transaction value field.

They can also apply a max value that's independent of the value limit.

Only one transfer policy is available per targeted contract (per account),
so they don't stack it overwrites if you apply a new policy to the same address.

```ts
type TransferPolicy = {
  target: Address;
  maxValuePerUse?: bigint;
  valueLimit?: bigint | Limit;
};
```

### Call Policy

This is a much more dynamic policy than a transfer policy that can be specified at
the contract (address) level, as well as the specific function selector.
Again,
this policy is unique per target + selector,
so only one policy is applied per transaction.

```ts
type CallPolicy = {
  target: Address;
  functionSelector?: string | AbiFunction | Hash;
  maxValuePerUse?: bigint;
  valueLimit?: bigint | Limit;
  constraints?: Constraint[];
};
```

The powerful part of call policies are the list of constraints,
which can apply multiple conditional logic statements to individual values within the transaction data.
These conditions are checked in order,
so any condition failure (not unconstrained) will cause the validation to fail.
The index of the constraint provides the offset from the start of the transaction data
so depending on the data layout any static data can be validated.
Each condition track it's own limit,
making this approach flexible enough to support adding limits to individual arguments to
contract function calls.

```typescript
export enum Condition {
  Unconstrained = 0,
  Equal = 1,
  Greater = 2,
  Less = 3,
  GreaterEqual = 4,
  LessEqual = 5,
  NotEqual = 6,
}


type Constraint = {
  index: number | bigint;
  condition: Condition | keyof typeof Condition;
  refValue: Hash;
  limit: Limit;
};

```

This design was inspired by [Smart Sessions](https://github.com/erc7579/smartsessions/blob/main/contracts/external/policies/UniActionPolicy.sol).
For those looking to configure sessions to restrict access to functions,
understanding the storage layout of the sessions will help when setting the function selector and limits.

Again, the split between call policy and transfer policy means that only *one* policy will be enforced per account transaction,
and it will be determined based on the amount of data provided.
