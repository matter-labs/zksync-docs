description: Get familiar with ZKsync SSO interfaces
---

While the internal functionality can be quite complex, the external interfaces for developers are very simple.
This provides some technical information on how these components can be used.

### Auth Server

The entrypoint to the SDK is via the ``zksyncSsoConnector`` to connect to the *Auth Server*.
This takes the session config, basic app information (name, icon), and Auth Server URL. The fully expanded type looks like:

<!-- // cspell: disable -->

```ts
/**
  * Options for creating a ZKsync SSO connector
  * @member metadata - Defaults to page title and website favicon
  * @member session - Session configuration preferences
  * @member authServerUrl - URL of the Auth Server
  */
type ZksyncSsoConnectorOptions = {
  metadata?: {
    name: string,
    icon?: string,
  },
  session?: SessionPreferences,
  authServerUrl?: string;
};
```
<!-- // cspell: enable -->

This returns a [WAGMI connector](https://wagmi.sh/core/api/connectors) that can be used to perform wallet-like
actions with the available account.
All of the functionality is then exposed via WAGMI,
making the ZKsync SSO account nearly indistinguishable from any other standard wallet provider!

## Sessions

Sessions allow only those transactions that are explicitly allowed by the session configuration.

```ts
/**
  * Options for creating a ZKsync SSO connector
  * @member expiresAt - Expiry time for the session (e.g. "8 hours"). Defaults are set by the Auth Server (currently 1 day).
  * @member feeLimit - Maximum amount of ETH that can be spent on gas fees
  * @member transfers - ETH transfer transaction policies
  * @member contractCalls - Contract call transaction policies
  */
type SessionPreferences = {
  expiresAt?: string | bigint | Date;
  feeLimit?: Limit,
  transfers?: TransferPolicy[];
  contractCalls?: CallPolicy[];
}
```

### Limits

#### Limit Types

- **Unlimited**: No limit is enforced
- **Lifetime**: Limit is enforced over the lifetime of the session
- **Allowance**: Limit is enforced over a specific period of time and is reset every `period` seconds (based on the `block.timestamp`)

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
`Allowance` limits are currently WORK-IN-PROGRESS. Transaction validation will fail if it relies on this limit type.
::

```ts
type LimitType =
  "Unlimited" |
  "Lifetime" |
  "Allowance";
```

#### Limit Use Cases

Limits are used in two places:

- **Value Policies**: Limits the amount of ETH that can be transferred
- **Function Argument Constraints**: Limits the amount that can be passed to a contract function (argument is parsed as `uint256`)

```ts
/**
 * @member limitType - Type of limit to enforce
 * @member limit - The limit is exceeded if the tracked value is greater than set value over the provided period (if applicable)
 * @member period - Resets limit every `period` seconds. The block.timestamp divisor for the limit to be enforced (eg: "60 minutes", "24 hours")
 */
type Limit =
  bigint | // Resolves to "lifetime" limit
  { limit: bigint; period?: string | bigint } | // If period is set resolves to "allowance" limit, otherwise "lifetime"
  { limitType: "lifetime"; limit: bigint } |
  { limitType: "unlimited" } |
  { limitType: "allowance"; limit: bigint; period: string | bigint };
```

### Transfer Policy

Allowed ETH transfers (non-contract calls).

```ts
/**
 * @member to - Allowed recipient address
 * @member maxValuePerUse - Per transaction ETH limit
 * @member valueLimit - Cumulative ETH limit
 */
type TransferPolicy = {
  to: Address;
  maxValuePerUse?: bigint;
  valueLimit?: Limit;
};
```

### Contract Call Policy

Allowed contract calls.

```ts
/**
 * @member address - Contract address
 * @member abi - Contract ABI
 * @member functionName - Function name to call
 * @member maxValuePerUse - Per transaction limit for the ETH value included in the transaction
 * @member valueLimit - Cumulative limit for the ETH value of the transaction
 * @member constraints - List of constraints to apply to the function arguments; unconstrained if not set
 */
type CallPolicy = {
  address: Address;
  abi: Abi;
  functionName: string;
  maxValuePerUse?: bigint;
  valueLimit?: PartialLimit;
  constraints?: Constraint[];
};
```

### Constraints

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
If constraints are not set, the function allows any argument values.
::

Constraints enforce limits on the arguments of a contract call.
They can be stacked and are checked in order.
Any constraint failure will cause the transaction validation to fail.

```ts
/**
 * @member index - Index of the argument to check
 * @member value - Value of the argument to compare against
 * @member condition - The kind of check to perform (None, =, >, <, >=, <=, !=)
 * @member limit - Limit to enforce on the parsed value
 */
type Constraint = {
  index: number;
  value?: unknown;
  condition?: ConstraintCondition;
  limit?: Limit;
};
```

```ts
type ConstraintCondition =
  "Unconstrained" | // No constraint
  "Equal" |         // =
  "Greater" |       // >
  "Less" |          // <
  "GreaterEqual" |  // >=
  "LessEqual" |     // <=
  "NotEqual";       // !=
```
