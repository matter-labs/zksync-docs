description: Understand transaction flows when using ZKsync SSO.

This section outlines the flow for user authentication and session management within an application using ZKsync SSO.

### 1. User Initiates Sign-In

- **Action**: The user navigates to an app featuring the **"Sign in with ZKsync"** option.

### 2. Authentication Options
**Sign Up:**

- **Action**: User is prompted to create a passkey (e.g., Face ID or Touch ID)

- **Process**: A new smart contract account is deployed by ZKsync SSO Auth Server using a shared, subsidized factory.

**Sign In:**

- **Action**: User is prompted to enter a passkey (e.g., Face ID or Touch ID)

### 3. Application requests a session (optional)

- **Action**: ZKsync SSO presents the permissions and operations to be granted, including:
  - Permitted Methods: Methods that can be called
  - Allowed Arguments: Arguments that can be passed
  - Authorized Targets: Destinations for transferring funds
  - Spending & Argument Limits: Restrictions on the amount of funds spent and the values of arguments passed

### 4. User Approval

- **Action**: The user reviews and approves the requested permissions and enters the passkey.

- **Process**:

  - ZKsync SSO Auth Server records the permissions in the smart contract account.
  - The user is redirected back to the app.

### 5. Session Key Utilization (If the app requested a session)

- **Outcome**: The app obtains a **session key**, enabling it to sign transactions on behalf of the user without further biometric authentication requests
(e.g., Face ID or Touch ID).

### 6. Session Key Expiration (If the app requested a session)

- **Note**: If the session key expires, the user must repeat the sign-in process to reauthorize permissions using their passkey.
