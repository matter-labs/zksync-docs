### 1. User Initiates Sign-In

- **Action**: The user navigates to an app featuring the **"Sign in with ZKsync"** option.

### 2. Authentication Options
**Sign Up:**
- **Action**: User is prompted to create up a passkey (e.g., Face ID or Touch ID)

- **Process**: A new smart contract account deployed by ZKsync SSO Auth Server using a shared, subsidized factory.

**Sign On:**
- **Action**: User is prompted to enter a passkey (e.g., Face ID or Touch ID)

### 3. Application requested a session (optional)
- **Action**: The ZKsync SSO presents the permissions and actions to be granted, including:
    - Spend limits
    - Session key duration
    - Custom module installations

### 4. User Approval

- **Action**: The user reviews and approves the requested permissions and enters the passkey.
- **Process**:
    - ZKsync SSO Auth Server records the permissions in the smart contract account.
    - The user is redirected back to the app.


### 5. Session Key Utilization (If app requested a session)

- **Outcome**: The app obtains a **session key**, enabling it to sign transactions on behalf of the user without further biometric authentication requests (e.g., Face ID or Touch ID).


### 6. Session Key Expiration (If app requested a session)

- **Note**: If the session key expires, the user must repeat the sign-in process to reauthorize permissions using their passkey.
