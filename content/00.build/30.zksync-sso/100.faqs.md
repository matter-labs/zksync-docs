## What login options are supported?

Currently, only login with passkeys is supported in ZKSync SSO.
We are working on adding support for logging in with an Externally Owned Account (EOA) as well.

## What are passkeys?

Passkeys are digital credentials that eliminate the need for traditional passwords by using asymmetric cryptography for authentication.
They consist of a key pair:

- **Private Key**: Stored securely on the user's device (e.g., in a secure enclave or Trusted Platform Module), never leaves the device.
- **Public Key**: Shared with the replaying party provider ZKSync SSO Auth Server and associated smart contracts during registration.

Passkeys are based on the [WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/) API and the FIDO2 standards,
which support various authenticators like built-in device biometrics (fingerprint sensors, facial recognition)
or external hardware security keys (YubiKey, SoloKeys).

## What recovery options are available if I lose my passkey?
In case a user loses their passkeys, ZKSync SSO provides several methods to recover their account:

**Multiple Devices with Passkey Synchronization**
Users can synchronize their passkeys across multiple devices using services like iCloud Keychain for Apple devices or similar services on other platforms.
This means if one device is lost, the passkeys are still accessible on other synchronized devices.

**Adding another passkey - *coming soon***
Users can register a new device by adding a new passkey to their account. This typically involves verifying their identity on the new device,
after which the new passkey is securely associated with their account.

**Recovery via Externally Owned Account (EOA) - *coming soon***
Users will soon be able to link an EOA to their ZKSync SSO account. If passkeys are lost, they can recover access by authenticating with their EOA,
providing an additional layer of security and recovery option.

**Recovery via OAuth - *coming soon***
OAuth Recovery ERC-7579 module enables users to setup an account recovery through OAuth tokens associated with their existing Web2 logins like
Gmail, Facebook, or X (formerly Twitter). This allows users to regain access by logging in with their familiar social media or email accounts
