description: Learn about ZKsync Smart Sign-on.
---

ZKsync SSO is a smart wallet and sign-on designed for developers building on the ZKsync.
It simplifies user authentication, session management,
and transaction processing by leveraging native ZKsync features like Account Abstraction (AA) and paymasters. <br><br>
This means you can integrate secure sign-on functionality into your applications without the need to develop complex wallet infrastructures
or worry about compatibility with third-party wallets.
Users logging in with ZKsync SSO on Era automatically access these advanced capabilities,
allowing you to focus on your application's core functionality rather than wallet implementation details.
