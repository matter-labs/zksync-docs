description: Learn about architectural components of ZKsync SSO and how they work together.
---

The ZKSync SSO consists of three components that work together to offer a seamless experience for both developers and users.

## ZKSync SSO Developer SDK

The **Developer SDK** is a client-side library that developers can integrate into their applications with minimal effort.
It handles account authentication, session management, and spend limit controls,
allowing developers to enhance security and streamline the user experience without dealing with complex wallet and key management infrastructure.

**Features:**

- **Authentication:** Enables users to authenticate using passkeys, supporting biometric methods like Face ID and fingerprint recognition.
- **Session and Spend Limit Management:** Allows applications to manage user sessions with specific token limits,
enhancing security by restricting the scope and usage of session keys.

**Platforms:**

- **Web SDK:** Available now, implemented in JavaScript for web applications.
- **Swift SDK:** For iOS applications (*coming soon*).
- **Kotlin SDK:** For Android applications (*coming soon*).

### Auth Server

The **Auth Server** is a stateless, off-chain hosted service (provided by ZKsync as a public good) that facilitates key aspects of the authentication process.
It acts as an intermediary between the client application and the ZKSync chain, handling:

- **Passkey Creation:** Assists in generating and managing user passkeys for authentication.
- **Session Creation:** Manages user sessions, including session keys and their associated permissions.
- **Transaction Signatures:** Signs transactions on behalf of the user within the constraints of their session limits.

This server ensures that sensitive operations are handled securely and efficiently without exposing
private keys or requiring users to manage complex cryptographic details.

## Smart Contracts

A set of smart contracts deployed on the ZKSync chain manage accounts, authentication modules, and session keys.
These contracts form the on-chain backbone of the ZKSync SSO system.

- **ERC7579Account.** Implements the ERC-7579 standard for modular smart contract accounts, allowing for extensible account functionalities.
- **AAFactory.** A factory contract used to deploy new user accounts on the chain efficiently.
- **[SessionLimitSessionKeyModule.](/build/zksync-sso/features#sessions)**
Manages session keys with specific token limits, enhancing security by restricting their scope and usage.
- **WebAuthnModule.** Handles authentication using WebAuthn standards, enabling passkey-based authentication methods.
- **Account Proxies**. Each user account is associated with an account proxy, facilitating interactions with the user's smart contract account.
