title: Quickstart with Atlas

Atlas is a browser-based IDE with an integrated AI assistant that allows you to write, test and deploy smart contracts
directly from your browser. Click the button below to open the project in Atlas.

### Compile and deploy the contract

Enter a name for the project and you will see the contract in the Atlas code editor.
On the right side, make sure the selected network is “%%zk_testnet_name%%“
and click on **“Deploy”** to trigger the smart contract compilation and deployment.

Behind the scenes, Atlas is using the ZKsync Era custom solidity compiler
(named `zksolc` ) to generate ZKEVM compatible bytecode. [Learn more about ZKsync custom compilers](/zk-stack/components/compiler/toolchain).

Once compiled sign the transaction with your wallet and wait until it's processed. You’ll see the contract in the
“Deployed contracts” section. Congratulations, you’ve deployed your first smart contract to %%zk_testnet_name%%!

### Interact with the contract

Below the contract name you can find its deployment address. The “Live Contract State” section displays the smart
contract balance and the value returned by the `getTotalMessages` function.

The “Write Functions” section contains the form to interact with the `sendMessage` function. Write a message, click the
“Run” button and confirm the transaction in your wallet. You’ll see that the `getTotalMessages` is updated to `1` and
`getLastMessage` returns the message you just sent. That means our contract is storing the messages as expected! But how
can you see the replies from Zeek?
