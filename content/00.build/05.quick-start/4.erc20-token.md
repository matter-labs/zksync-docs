title: Create an ERC20 token
description: In this tutorial you'll build and deploy an ERC20 token to %%zk_testnet_name%%
---

This tutorial shows you how to deploy and interact with an ERC20 token on %%zk_testnet_name%%.

This is what you're going to do:

:check-icon Build an ERC20 token smart contract with additional custom logic

:check-icon Deploy the smart contract to the %%zk_testnet_name%% using Remix or Atlas.

## Prerequisites

1. Before you start, make sure that
[you’ve configured the %%zk_testnet_name%% in your wallet](/build/connect-to-zksync).
2. Have at least 0.5 %%zk_testnet_name%% ETH. If you need more, use [one of the faucets](/ecosystem/network-faucets).

To complete this tutorial you'll use either Atlas or Remix. Select your preferred tool:
