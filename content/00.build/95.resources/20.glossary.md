### **Account Abstraction**

Account Abstraction enhances transaction authorizations by making them programmable,
offering more flexibility than Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs).
This innovation aims to enrich user experiences and broaden the scope of transaction authorizations,
differing from EIP-4337.

### **ZKsync VM**

ZKsync VM is the name of the architecture that enables zero-knowledge proof generation
for the execution trace of smart contracts originally written for EVM.

### **EVM Equivalent**

EVM Equivalent means that a given protocol supports every opcode
of Ethereum’s EVM down to the bytecode.
Thus, any EVM smart contract works with 100% assurance out of the box.

### **EVM Compatible**

EVM Compatible means that a percentage of the opcodes of Ethereum’s EVM are supported;
thus, a percentage of smart contracts work out of the box.
ZKsync is optimized to be EVM source-code compatible (with a custom compiler), not EVM equivalent.
