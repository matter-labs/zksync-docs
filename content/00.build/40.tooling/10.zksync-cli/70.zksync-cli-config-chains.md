description: Configure custom chains to use with zksync-cli.
---

Specify your own chain configuration by adding or editing custom chains to use on `zksync-cli`.
This feature is essential for developers looking to interact with ZK Stack Chains.

## Configuring Custom Chains

To add or edit a custom chain, use the following command:

```bash
zksync-cli config chains
```

Upon execution, you will be guided through a series of prompts to enter specific details for the custom chain, including:

- **Chain ID**: The id for the chain.
- **Chain Name**: A name for the chain.
- **Chain key**: A unique identifier for the chain.
- **RPC URL**: The RPC endpoint URL for interacting with the chain.
- **Other Information**: Depending on the chain's requirements, you may need to provide additional information such as block explorer URLs.

## Using Custom Chains

Once a custom chain is configured, you can use it across various `zksync-cli` commands.
All of your custom chains will be listed in the chain selection prompt, allowing you to select and use them as needed.
You can also specify a custom chain directly using the `--chain` option, for example:

```bash
zksync-cli wallet balance --chain <custom-chain-key>
```
