description: Learn how to use the powerful zkSync CLI tool for local development.
---

The zkSync Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool designed to simplify the development and interaction with zkSync from a command shell.

## Usage

You can run commands locally without installation using the following command: `npx zksync-cli`. For example: `npx zksync-cli dev start`.

### Install zksync-cli

You can alternatively install the CLI globally using the npm package manager:

```bash
npm install -g zksync-cli
```

If you go the route of installing the zksync-cli package locally, we recommend using the global option.

### Update zksync-cli

```
