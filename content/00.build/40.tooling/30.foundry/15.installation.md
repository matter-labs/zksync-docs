description: Learn how to install and configure Foundry for ZKsync
---

This guide will walk you through installing `foundry-zksync`, a specialized toolchain
for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on ZKsync. You can install
`foundry-zksync` by using the `foundryup-zksync` installer, precompiled binaries, or by building it from source.

## Installing with foundryup-zksync

`foundryup-zksync` is the official installer for the Foundry-ZKsync toolchain.
It allows you to easily install and manage the latest versions of `forge` and `cast`.

Please note that this installation overrides any existing forge and cast binaries in ~/.foundry.
You can use forge without the --zksync flag for standard EVM chains. To revert to a previous installation, follow the instructions
[here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation#using-foundryup).

To install `foundryup-zksync`, follow these steps:

### 1. Install via the provided script

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/main/install-foundry-zksync | bash
```

By default, this will install the latest (nightly) precompiled versions
of `forge` and `cast`. To see more installation options, such as installing a specific version, run:

```bash
foundryup-zksync --help
```

### Important Notes

- Currently, only `forge` and `cast` are supported for ZKsync. Other commands retain their original behavior but may not work as intended.
- **Windows Users**: You need to use Git BASH or WSL, as `foundryup-zksync` does not
support PowerShell or Cmd. Windows support is currently provided on a best-effort basis.

## Precompiled Binaries

Precompiled binaries are available for download from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases).
We recommend using the latest nightly build to stay up-to-date with the latest features and fixes.

### Available Binaries

- **macOS (Intel)**: [foundry_nightly_darwin_amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_darwin_amd64.tar.gz)
- **macOS (Apple)**: [foundry_nightly_darwin_arm64.tar.gz](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_darwin_arm64.tar.gz)
- **Linux (Intel)**: [foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz)
- **Linux (ARM)**: [foundry_nightly_linux_arm64.tar.gz](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_linux_arm64.tar.gz)

To download and install one of these binaries, follow these steps:

```bash
# Example for macOS Intel (amd64)
wget -qc https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_darwin_amd64.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz
# Move to a location in your PATH, for example:
sudo mv ./forge /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv ./cast /usr/local/bin/
```

Repeat for your platform, replacing the URL with the appropriate binary.

## Building from Source

If you prefer to build `foundry-zksync` from source, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Rust Compiler and Cargo**: The easiest way to install them is via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Nightly Rust**: `foundry-zksync` generally supports only a specific nightly version
of Rust, which is automatically set by the presence of a `rust-toolchain` file in the project.

### Build Instructions

There are multiple ways to build from source:

#### Option 1: Using `foundryup-zksync` flags

To build from a specific branch or path:

```bash
# Build from the master branch
foundryup-zksync --branch master

# Build from a local path
foundryup-zksync --path path/to/foundry-zksync
```

#### Option 2: Using Cargo

You can install the toolchain directly using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync --profile release --locked forge cast
```

#### Option 3: Manually building from a local clone

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync.git
cd foundry-zksync

# Install Forge
cargo install --path ./crates/forge --profile release --force --locked

# Install Cast
cargo install --path ./crates/cast --profile release --force --locked
```

## Installing for CI in GitHub Actions

To install `foundry-zksync` for CI pipelines, the latest precompiled binaries for your
architecture can be downloaded directly from the release page. Below is an example for a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Download binaries
    run: |
      wget -qc https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz
      ./forge -V && ./cast -V
```
