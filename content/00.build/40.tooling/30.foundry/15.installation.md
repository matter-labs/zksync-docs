description: Learn how to install and configure Foundry for ZKsync
---

This guide will walk you through installing Foundry ZKsync, a specialized toolchain
for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on ZKsync. You can install
Foundry ZKsync by using the `foundryup-zksync` installer, downloading precompiled binaries, or by building it from source.

## Installing with `foundryup-zksync`

`foundryup-zksync` is the official installer for the Foundry ZKsync toolchain.
It allows you to easily install and manage the latest versions of `forge` and `cast`.

Please note that this installation overrides any existing forge and cast binaries in `~/.foundry`.
You can use forge without the `--zksync` flag for standard EVM chains. To revert to a previous installation, follow the instructions
on [Using foundryup on the official Foundry website](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation#using-foundryup).

To install `foundryup-zksync`, follow these steps:

### 1. Install via the provided script

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/main/install-foundry-zksync | bash
```

By default, this will install the latest (nightly) precompiled versions
of `forge` and `cast`. To see more installation options, such as installing a specific version, run:

```bash
foundryup-zksync --help
```

### Important Notes

- Currently, only `forge` and `cast` are supported for ZKsync. Other commands retain their original behavior but may not work as intended.
- **Windows Users**: You need to use Git BASH or WSL, as `foundryup-zksync` does not support PowerShell or Cmd,
and we do not provide Windows executable binaries. Windows support is currently provided on a best-effort basis.

## Precompiled Binaries

Precompiled binaries are available for download from the
[`foundry-zksync` GitHub releases page](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases).
We recommend using the latest nightly build to stay up-to-date with the latest features and fixes.

### Available Binaries

- **macOS (Intel)**: [foundry_nightly_darwin_amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_darwin_amd64.tar.gz)
- **macOS (Apple)**: [foundry_nightly_darwin_arm64.tar.gz](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_darwin_arm64.tar.gz)
- **Linux (Intel)**: [foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz)
- **Linux (ARM)**: [foundry_nightly_linux_arm64.tar.gz](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_linux_arm64.tar.gz)

To download and install one of these binaries, follow these steps:

```bash
# Example for macOS Intel (amd64)
wget -qc https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_darwin_amd64.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz
# Move to a location in your PATH, for example:
sudo mv ./forge /usr/local/bin/
sudo mv ./cast /usr/local/bin/
```

Repeat for your platform, replacing the URL with the appropriate binary.

## Building from Source

If you prefer to build Foundry ZKsync from source, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Rust Compiler and Cargo**: The easiest way to install them is via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Nightly Rust**: Foundry ZKsync generally supports only a specific nightly version
of Rust, which is automatically set by the presence of a `rust-toolchain` file in the project.

### Build Instructions

There are multiple ways to build from source:

#### Option 1: Using `foundryup-zksync` flags

To build from a specific branch or path:

```bash
# Build from the main branch
foundryup-zksync --branch main

# Build from a local path
foundryup-zksync --path path/to/foundry-zksync
```

#### Option 2: Using Cargo

You can install the toolchain directly using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync --profile release --locked forge cast
```

#### Option 3: Manually building from a local clone

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync.git
cd foundry-zksync

# Install Forge
cargo install --path ./crates/forge --profile release --force --locked

# Install Cast
cargo install --path ./crates/cast --profile release --force --locked
```

## Installing for CI in GitHub Actions

To install Foundry ZKsync for CI pipelines, the latest precompiled binaries for your
architecture can be downloaded directly from the release page. Below is an example for a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Download binaries
    run: |
      wget -qc https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/releases/download/nightly/foundry_nightly_linux_amd64.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz
      ./forge -V && ./cast -V
```

## Configuration

### Using `foundry.toml`

Foundry is highly configurable through a `foundry.toml` file, located in the root of your project or any parent directory.
For a full list of configuration options, see the [config package documentation](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/blob/main/crates/config/README.md#all-options).

#### Profiles

You can organize configuration options using profiles. The default profile is named
`default`. See more about the [Default profile on `foundry-zksync` README](https://github.com/matter-labs/foundry-zksync/blob/main/crates/config/README.md#default-profile).

To switch profiles, use the `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` environment variable. You can also override specific settings using environment variables prefixed
with `FOUNDRY_` or `DAPP_`, such as `FOUNDRY_SRC`.

#### Initialization

The `forge init` command generates a basic `foundry.toml` file, which you can extend as needed.

#### Viewing Configuration

To view your current configuration:

- Run `forge config` to see all options.
- Run `forge config --basic` for a simplified view (as initialized with `forge init`).
- You can generate a new `foundry.toml` file with `forge config --basic > foundry.toml`.

By default, `forge config` displays the active profile and its values. It also accepts the same arguments as `forge build`.

#### Example `foundry.toml` for ZKsync

Here's an example configuration for ZKsync with `zksolc` settings:

```toml
[profile.default]
src = 'src'
out = 'out'
libs = ['lib']

[profile.default.zksync]
compile = true
fallback_oz = true
mode = '3'
```

### Additional Configuration

You can find additional setup and configurations guides in the [official Foundry Book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/):

- [Setting up VSCode](https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/vscode)
- [Shell autocompletions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/config/shell-autocompletion)
