### hardhat-gas-reporter

<!-- TODO: update link -->
<!-- Although this plugin works out of the box, zkSync Era has a [different fee model](../../developer-reference/fee-model.md) than Ethereum.  -->
Users should consider this when analysing the report generated by this plugin.

<!-- TODO: update link -->
<!-- In addition, make sure to read about [local testing](../../test-and-debug/getting-started.md). -->

[More Information](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-gas-reporter)

### hardhat-preprocessor

This plugin enables the pre-processing of contract source code prior to compilation.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
**CACHE_BREAKER Field Issue**:

The hardhat-preprocessor plugin adds the CACHE_BREAKER field to the list of libraries,
which can lead to failed verification when using [hardhat-zksync-verify](./hardhat-zksync-verify) plugin.
To prevent this, please include the `--no-compile` flag: `yarn hardhat verify --no-compile`.

## Unsupported plugins

### nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers

This plugin adds new methods that interact with the Hardhat network used for testing.

However, we do not recommend using the Hardhat network for testing contracts that will be deployed on zkSync Era.
<!-- TODO: update links -->
<!-- We recommend instead using the [in-memory node](../../test-and-debug/era-test-node.md)
or the [docker setup to test your contracts](../../test-and-debug/dockerized-l1-l2-nodes.md)
as they will give you the same results as our testnet/mainnet. -->

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
The additional methods provided by this plugin are not compatible with the zkSync Era in-memory node or docker setup yet.
Currently, we are working on adapting our in-memory node to ensure compatibility with hardhat-network-helpers.
