Before exploring ZKsync development with Hardhat, ensure your environment is properly set up. Follow these steps to install the necessary tools and
meet the prerequisites for a smooth development experience.

### Prerequisites

**System requirements:**

- Ensure your machine meets the [system requirements](%%zk_git_repo_era-compiler-solidity%%/tree/main#system-requirements) for running ZKsync and
Hardhat. For Windows users, using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) is highly recommended for better compatibility.

**Node.js and package manager:**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 18 or newer.
- Choose a package manager: [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

**Familiarity with Ethereum development:**

- Basic knowledge of deploying smart contracts on Ethereum is beneficial. Refer to
   the [Contract Deployment](/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/contract-deployment) documentation if you need a refresher.

**Wallet and testnet funds:**

- You’ll need a wallet with sufficient ETH to deploy contracts.
  See the [Network Faucets](/ecosystem/network-faucets) page to find a list of resources to obtain testnet funds.
- Ensure you know how to [export your private key from MetaMask](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).

If you're migrating an existing hardhat project to `zksync-era`, please refer to
the [migration guide](/build/tooling/hardhat/guides/migrating-to-zksync) for
detailed instructions.

### Installation steps

**Install ZKsync CLI:**

- The ZKsync CLI simplifies project setup and local testing. Install it globally with npm or yarn:

::code-group

  ```bash [yarn]
    yarn global add zksync-cli
  ```

  ```bash [npm]
    npm install -g zksync-cli
  ```

::

**Create a new project:**

- Use the ZKsync CLI to create a new Hardhat project. Choose the template based on your contract language (Solidity or Vyper):

#### Solidity project

```bash
npx zksync-cli create demo --template hardhat_solidity
```

#### Vyper project

```sh
npx zksync-cli create demo --template hardhat_vyper
```

Replace `<project-name>` with your desired project name. This command creates a `demo` folder and clones a Hardhat template project inside it.
The downloaded project is already configured and contains all the required plugins.
::

**Configure Hardhat:**

- Open your project's `hardhat.config.ts` file and configure it according to your project needs. This includes setting up ZKsync network
   endpoints and compiler versions.

**Set up your environment:**

- Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your wallet’s private key:

     ```text
     WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=YourPrivateKeyHere
     ```

For development and testing, it is recommended to use burner wallets. Avoid using real private keys to prevent security risks.
::

**Install project dependencies:**

- Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
  yarn install
```

```bash [npm]
  npm install
```

::

**Compile your contracts:**

- Before deploying, compile your contracts:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn hardhat compile
```

```bash [npx]
npx hardhat compile
```

::

**Deploy and test:**

- Use Hardhat scripts to deploy your contracts.
