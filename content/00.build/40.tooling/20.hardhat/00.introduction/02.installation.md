Before exploring ZKsync development with Hardhat, ensure your environment is properly set up. This guide walks you through the process of creating
a ZKsync project with Hardhat using the ZKsync CLI, which provides pre-built templates that include all necessary Hardhat plugins.

If you're migrating an existing Hardhat project to `zksync-era`, please refer to
the [migration guide](/build/tooling/hardhat/guides/migrating-to-zksync) for detailed instructions.
::

## Prerequisites

### System requirements

- Ensure your machine meets the [system requirements](%%zk_git_repo_era-compiler-solidity%%/tree/main#system-requirements) for running ZKsync and
Hardhat. For Windows users, using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) is highly recommended for better compatibility.

### Node.js and package manager

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 18 or newer.

### Familiarity with Ethereum development

- Basic knowledge of deploying smart contracts on Ethereum is beneficial. Refer to
the [Contract Deployment](/build/developer-reference/ethereum-differences/contract-deployment) documentation if you need a refresher.

### Wallet and testnet funds

- You’ll need a wallet with sufficient ETH to deploy contracts.
- See the [Network Faucets](/ecosystem/network-faucets) page to find a list of resources to obtain testnet funds.

### Install ZKsync CLI

The ZKsync CLI simplifies project setup and local testing by providing pre-configured templates for your projects. Install it globally with npm or yarn:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
  yarn global add zksync-cli
```

```bash [npm]
  npm install -g zksync-cli
```

::

## Installation steps

### Create a new project

Use the ZKsync CLI to create a new Hardhat project. Replace `<project-name>` with your desired project name. This command creates
a `<project-name>` folder and clones a Hardhat template project inside it. Choose the template based on your contract language (Solidity or Vyper):

::code-group

```bash [Solidity]
zksync-cli create <project-name> --template hardhat_solidity
```

```sh [Vyper]
zksync-cli create <project-name> --template hardhat_vyper
```

::

> The downloaded project is already configured and contains all the required plugins.

### Configure Hardhat

- The Hardhat configuration is already set up when you use the ZKsync CLI. The `hardhat.config.ts` file in your project will already include the
necessary configurations for ZKsync, so no additional configuration should be required.

### Set up your environment

- Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your wallet’s private key:

```text
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=YourPrivateKeyHere
```

For development and testing, it is recommended to use burner wallets. Avoid using real private keys to prevent security risks.
::

### Compile your contracts

Before deploying, compile your contracts:

::code-group

```bash [yarn]
yarn hardhat compile
```

```bash [npx]
npx hardhat compile
```

::

### Deploy and test

- Use Hardhat scripts to deploy your contracts.
