### hardhat-gas-reporter

Although this plugin works out of the box, ZKsync Era has a [different fee model](/build/developer-reference/fee-model) than Ethereum.
Users should consider this when analysing the report generated by this plugin.

In addition, make sure to read about [local testing](/build/test-and-debug/).

### hardhat-preprocessor

This plugin enables the pre-processing of contract source code prior to compilation.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
**CACHE_BREAKER Field Issue**:

The hardhat-preprocessor plugin adds the CACHE_BREAKER field to the list of libraries,
which can lead to failed verification when using [hardhat-zksync-verify](hardhat-zksync-verify) plugin.
To prevent this, please include the `--no-compile` flag: `yarn hardhat verify --no-compile`.

### nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers

This plugin adds new methods that interact with the Hardhat network used for testing.

In version `1.0.12`, `hardhat-network-helpers` introduced support for both in-memory anvil-zksync node and Dockerized setups, allowing methods
such as `loadFixture` to be utilized in test files.

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}
Although methods like `hardhat_impersonateAccount` or `hardhat_setBalance` are supported, other RPC methods might not be supported by anvil-zksync node.
Please [check the list of suported APIs](https://github.com/matter-labs/anvil-zksync/blob/main/SUPPORTED_APIS.md).

## Unsupported plugins

### nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan

This plugin has been deprecated in favor of `nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify`. The ZKsync plugins for smart contract verification are built
on top of `nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify`, making migration to it necessary.
