The [zkSync Era Block Explorer](%%zk_mainnet_block_explorer_url%%)
details comprehensive data about transactions, blocks, batches, wallets, tokens, and smart contracts on the zkSync Era network.

## Block Explorer API

We’ve developed the zkSync Era Block Explorer API for developers to access zkSync Era Block Explorer data directly via HTTP requests.

- [Mainnet Block Explorer API](%%zk_mainnet_block_explorer_url%%/docs)
- [Testnet Block Explorer API](%%zk_testnet_block_explorer_url%%/docs)

The API provides various endpoints for many use cases you might want in your app.
It is compatible with [Etherscan API](https://docs.etherscan.io/),
which makes it easy to transition your existing apps to zkSync Era network.

Feel free to contribute and create issues and feature requests in [zkSync Era Block Explorer GitHub repo](%%zk_git_repo_block-explorer%%).
