## Add ZKsync Era to your MetaMask wallet

You can add ZKsync Era to your MetaMask wallet using the buttons below:

:network-adder{ network="mainnet" }  :network-adder{ network="testnet" }

If you are using a different in-browser wallet, the buttons above may also work for them.

## Manually add ZKsync Era

To manually add ZKsync Era as a custom network in your wallet, follow these steps:

1. Find the “Add Network” option in your wallet (in MetaMask, you can find this in the networks dropdown).
1. Click on “Add Network" and "Add a network manually".
1. Fill in the following details for the ZKsync Era network environments:

### Mainnet network details

:display-partial{ path="_partials/_mainnet-network-details" }

### Sepolia testnet network details

:display-partial{ path="_partials/_testnet-network-details" }

## Get testnet funds for your wallet

Once you have your wallet connected to a ZKsync Era environment,
you can get testnet funds from one of many [testnet faucets](/ecosystem/network-faucets)
to use with [deploying your first smart contract](/build/start-coding/quick-start/deploy-your-first-contract).
