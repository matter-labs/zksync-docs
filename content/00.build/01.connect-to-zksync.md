## Add ZKsync Era to your MetaMask wallet

You can add ZKsync Era to your MetaMask wallet using the buttons below:

:network-adder{ network="mainnet" }  :network-adder{ network="testnet" }

If you are using a different in-browser wallet, the buttons above may also work for them.

## Manually add ZKsync Era

To manually add ZKsync Era as a custom network in your wallet, follow these steps:

1. Find the “Add Network” option in your wallet (in MetaMask, you can find this in the networks dropdown).
1. Click on “Add Network" and "Add network manually".
1. Fill in the following details for the ZKsync Era network environments:

### Mainnet network details

:display-partial{ path="_partials/_mainnet-network-details" }

### Sepolia testnet network details

:display-partial{ path="_partials/_testnet-network-details" }

## Get testnet funds for your wallet

Once you have your wallet connected to a ZKsync Era environment,
you can get testnet funds from one of many [testnet faucets](/ecosystem/network-faucets)
to use with [deploying your first smart contract](/build/start-coding/quick-start/deploy-your-first-contract).
