title: Building Smart Accounts
description: Discover the process of building custom smart accounts.
---

To build custom accounts on our platform, developers must implement specific
interfaces and follow our recommended best practices for account deployment and management.

### Interface Implementation

Every custom account should implement the [IAccount](design#iaccount-interface)
interface. You can find an example of a typical account implementation, resembling
standard Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) on Ethereum, in the
[DefaultAccount.sol](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/blob/main/system-contracts/contracts/DefaultAccount.sol) on GitHub.

This implementation returns an empty value when called by an external address, which may not be the desired behavior for your custom account.

### EIP1271 Integration

For smart wallets, we highly encourage the implementation of the [EIP1271](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1271) signature-validation scheme.
This standard is endorsed by the ZKsync team and is integral to our signature-verification library.

### Deployment Process

While deploying account logic is similar to deploying a standard smart contract,
itâ€™s important to differentiate contracts intended to function as accounts.
For this purpose, use the `createAccount` or `create2Account` methods of the deployer
system contract, rather than the general `create` or `create2` methods, which are
used for contracts not intended to act as accounts.

#### Example Using `zksync-ethers` SDK (v6)

You can use the [`ECDSASmartAccount`](https://sdk.zksync.io/js/ethers/api/v6/accounts/smartaccount-factories#ecdsasmartaccount) or
[`MultisigECDSASmartAccount`](https://sdk.zksync.io/js/ethers/api/v6/accounts/smartaccount-factories#multisigecdsasmartaccount)
to create a standard smart account or multisig smart account.

```ts
import { types, ECDSASmartAccount, MultisigECDSASmartAccount, } from "zksync-ethers";

const account = ECDSASmartAccount.create(ADDRESS, PRIVATE_KEY, provider);
const multisigAccount = MultisigECDSASmartAccount.create(multisigAddress, [PRIVATE_KEY1, PRIVATE_KEY2], provider);
```

You can also deploy with custom factory and account contracts using the example below.

```ts
async function deployAAFactory(hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  const deployer = hre.deployer;
  // the factory contract
  const factoryArtifact = await deployer.loadArtifact('AAFactory');
  // the account contract
  const aaArtifact = await deployer.loadArtifact('Account');

  const factory = await deployer.deploy(
    factoryArtifact,
    [utils.hashBytecode(aaArtifact.bytecode)],
    undefined,
    undefined,
    [aaArtifact.bytecode]
  );
  const factoryAddress = await factory.getAddress();
  console.log(`AA factory address: ${factoryAddress}`);
  return factory;
}
```

### Verification Step Limitations

::callout{icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle" color="amber"}

Currently, the verification rules for custom accounts are not fully enforced, which might change in the future:

- Accounts must only interact with slots that belong to them.
- Context variables (e.g., `block.number`) are prohibited in account logic.
- Accounts must increment the nonce by 1 to maintain hash collision resistance.

::

These limitations are not yet enforceable at the circuit/VM level and do not apply to L1->L2 transactions.

### Nonce Management

Both transaction and deployment nonces are consolidated within the
[NonceHolder](/build/developer-reference/era-contracts/system-contracts#nonceholder) system contract for optimization.
Use the [incrementMinNonceIfEquals](https://github.com/matter-labs/era-contracts/blob/6250292a98179cd442516f130540d6f862c06a16/system-contracts/contracts/NonceHolder.sol#L110)
function to safely increment your account's nonce.

### Sending Transactions

Currently, only EIP712 formatted transactions are supported for sending from custom
accounts. Transactions must specify the `from` field as the account's address and
include a `customSignature` in the `customData`.

#### Example Transaction Submission With a Private Key

To send a transaction using the private key of a deployed smart account, you can use the
[`SmartAccount`](https://sdk.zksync.io/js/ethers/api/v6/accounts/smartaccount#sendtransaction) class from `zksync-ethers`:

```ts
import { SmartAccount, Provider, types } from "zksync-ethers";
import { parseEther } from "ethers";

const provider = Provider.getDefaultProvider(types.Network.Sepolia);
const account = new SmartAccount({ address: ADDRESS, secret: PRIVATE_KEY }, provider);

const signedTx = await account.sendTransaction({
  to: recipientAddress,
  value: parseEther(amount),
});
```

#### Example Transaction Submission Without a Private Key

You can also manually add a custom signature to a transaction,
like in the example below.

```ts
import { types, Provider } from "zksync-ethers";
import { parseEther, AbiCoder } from "ethers";

const provider = new Provider(rpcUrl);
let tx: types.TransactionLike = {
  to: recipientAddress,
  value: parseEther(amount),
  gasPrice: await provider.getGasPrice(),
  gasLimit: BigInt(20000000),
  chainId: (await provider.getNetwork()).chainId,
  nonce: await provider.getTransactionCount(aaAddress),
};

const abiCoder = new AbiCoder();
const aaSignature = abiCoder.encode(
  ['string', 'string'],
  ['hello', 'world']
);

tx.from = aaAddress;
tx.type = 113;
tx.customData = {
  ...tx.customData,
  customSignature: aaSignature,
};
const sentTx = await provider.broadcastTransaction(
    types.Transaction.from(tx).serialized
  );
await sentTx.wait();
```
