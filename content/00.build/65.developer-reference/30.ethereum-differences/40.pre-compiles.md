title: Precompiles
---

Some EVM cryptographic precompiles (notably pairings and RSA) aren't currently available. However, pairing is
prioritized to allow deployment of both Hyperchains and protocols like Aztec/Dark Forest without modifications.

Ethereum cryptographic primitives like `ecrecover`, `keccak256`, `sha256`, `ecadd` and `ecmul` are supported as precompiles.
No actions are required from your side as all the calls to the precompiles are done by the compilers under the hood.

It's important to be aware that the gas costs and behaviors of these precompiles when invoked via delegatecall may differ from those on Ethereum.
