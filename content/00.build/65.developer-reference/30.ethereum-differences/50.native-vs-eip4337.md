title: Native AA vs EIP 4337
description:
---

The native account abstraction of ZKsync and Ethereum's EIP 4337 aim to enhance
accounts' flexibility and user experience, but they differ in critical aspects listed below:

1. **Implementation Level**: ZKsync's account abstraction is integrated at the
protocol level; however, EIP 4337 avoids the implementation at the protocol level.
2. **Account Types**: on ZKsync Era, smart contract accounts and paymasters are
first-class citizens. Under the hood, all accounts (even EOAs) behave like smart
contract accounts; **all accounts support paymasters**.
3. **Transaction Processing**: EIP 4337 introduces a separate transaction flow for
smart contract accounts, which relies on a separate mempool for user operations, and
Bundlers - nodes that bundle user operations and sends them to be processed by the
EntryPoint contract, resulting in two separate transaction flows. In contrast, on
ZKsync Era there is a unified mempool for transactions from both Externally Owned
Accounts (EOAs) and smart contract accounts. On ZKsync Era, the Operator takes on
the role of bundling transactions, irrespective of the account type, and sends them
to the Bootloader (similar to the EntryPoint contract), which results in a single
mempool and transaction flow.
4. **Paymasters support**: ZKsync Era allows both EOAs and smart contract accounts
to benefit from paymasters thanks to its single transaction flow. On the other hand,
EIP 4337 does not support paymasters for EOAs because paymasters are only
implemented in the new transaction flow for smart contract accounts.
