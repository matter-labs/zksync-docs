title: Create an ERC20 token
description: In this tutorial you'll build and deploy an ERC20 token to %%zk_testnet_name%%
---

This tutorial shows you how to deploy and interact with an ERC20 token on %%zk_testnet_name%%.

This is what we’re going to do:

:check-icon Build an ERC20 token smart contract with additional custom logic

:check-icon Deploy the smart contract to the %%zk_testnet_name%% using Remix or Atlas.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that you’ve configured the zkSync Sepolia tesnet in your browser wallet by following the
instructions here.

In addition, fund your wallet with testnet ETH on %%zk_testnet_name%%.

To complete this tutorial we’ll use either Atlas or Remix. Select your preferred tool:
