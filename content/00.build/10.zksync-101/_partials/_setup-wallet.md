title: Set up your wallet
---

Deploying contracts on the %%zk_testnet_name%% requires having testnet ETH.
If you're working within the local development environment,
you can utilize pre-configured rich wallets and skip this step.
For testnet deployments, you should have your wallet funded from the [previous step](/build/zksync-101#fund-your-wallet).

**Ensure that you've created keystore with your wallet private key** [as detailed in the getting started](/build/zksync-101#configure-your-wallet-in-a-project).
