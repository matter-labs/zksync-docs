              Hey there and thank you for opening this pull request! üëãüèº

              We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

              If your PR is still a work in progress, please prefix the title with "[WIP]".

              Details:

              ```
              ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
              ```

        # Delete a previous comment when the issue has been resolved
        - if: ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message == null }}
